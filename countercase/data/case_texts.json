Judgment / Order of the Supreme Court Judgment Satish Chandra Sharma, J. 1. On 30.08.1985, Neelam breathed her last in Simaltalla, PS Sikandra, District Munger, Bihar. The factum of her death was discovered in [2024] 10 S.C.R. 111 Vijay Singh @ Vijay Kr. Sharma v. The State of Bihar furtherance of the written report lodged by the informant and brother- in-law of the deceased, namely, Ramanand Singh (examined as PW18 before the Trial Court1) wherein he alleged that Neelam was abducted by seven persons from their house in an incident which occurred at around 10:00 PM on the said day. On the basis of this information, an FIR bearing no. 127 of 1985 was lodged at PS Sikandra and investigation was commenced which led to the filing of a chargesheet against the seven accused persons, namely - Krishna Nandan Singh (Accused No.1), Ram Nandan Singh (Accused No.2), Raj Nandan Singh (Accused No.3), Shyam Nandan Singh (Accused No.4), Bhagwan Singh (Accused No. 5), Vijay Singh (Accused No. 6) and Tanik Singh (Accused No.7). 2. The Trial Court charged all seven accused persons for the commission of offences punishable under Sections 323, 302, 364, 449, 450, 380/34 and 120-B of the Indian Penal Code, 1860.2 Later, accused nos. 6 and 7 were distinctly charged for the commission of offences punishable under Sections 342, 506 read with Section 34 of IPC. After trial, the Trial Court, vide order dated 05.06.1992, convicted the accused persons listed as accused nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 for the commission of offences under Section 302/34 and 364/34 of IPC. They were acquitted of all other charges, and accused nos. 6 and 7 were acquitted of all the charges. 3. The convicts preferred an appeal before the Patna High Court against the order of conviction and the State preferred an appeal before the High Court against the order of acquittal of the two accused persons. The Patna High Court, vide a common judgment dated 26.03.2015,3 upheld the conviction of the five convicts and set aside the acquittal of accused nos. 6 and 7 by finding them guilty of the commission of offences under Sections 364/34 and 302/34 of IPC. Accordingly, accused nos. 6 and 7 were also convicted and were sentenced to undergo rigorous life imprisonment on each count. The present batch of appeals assail the order/judgment dated 26.03.2015 of the Patna High Court. 1 Prosecution witness or PW 2 Hereinafter referred as \"IPC\" 3 Passed in Govt. Appeal (DB) No. 16/1992, Criminal Appeal (DB) No. 219/1992 and Criminal Appeal (DB) No. 271/1992 112 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports BRIEF FACTS 4. Shorn of unnecessary details, the facts reveal that deceased Neelam was the wife of one Ashok Kumar who happened to be the son of PW3/Ganesh Prasad Singh, and the informant PW18/Ramanand Singh was the brother of Ashok Kumar. The informant's case was that at the relevant point of time, the deceased was residing with her husband and the informant in the house belonging to her late father Jang Bahadur Singh, who belonged to Simaltalla. The house was partially occupied by the deceased, her husband and her brother- in-law and the remaining portion was rented out and tenants were residing in those portions. 5. As per the prosecution case, on 30.08.1985 at about 10:00 PM, PW18 was sitting outside the house on a rickshaw along with one Doman Tenti, Daso Mistry and Soordas, and Neelam was sleeping inside the house. Her husband, Ashok Kumar, had gone to his native place Ghogsha. Suddenly, the seven accused persons, including the appellants before us, came from north direction along with 15 other unknown assailants. Accused Vijay Singh/A-6 caught hold of the informant/PW18 and as soon as he raised alarm and started shouting, two unknown persons pointed out pistols towards him and directed him to maintain silence. Thereafter, the accused persons who had caught the informant, assaulted him with fists and slaps, and confined him near the well situated on the north side of the house. Meanwhile, A-1 entered the house with 5-7 other accused persons by getting the house unlatched through a resident namely Kumud Ranjan Singh and dragged Neelam out of the house. As soon as they dragged her out, four persons caught hold of Neelam by her arms and legs, lifted her and started moving towards Lohanda. As per the informant, the accused persons also picked up two sarees, two blouses, two petticoats and a pair of slippers from Neelam's room while going out. 6. As the informant raised alarm, other people of the mohalla also gathered around including PW2 Vinay Kumar Singh, PW4 Chandra Shekhar Prasad Singh and PW5 Ram Naresh Singh. The said three witnesses witnessed the accused persons taking away Neelam but could not stop them. The informant explained that no one dared to follow the accused persons as they had pointed pistols and had threatened of dire consequences. The informant also explained the [2024] 10 S.C.R. 113 Vijay Singh @ Vijay Kr. Sharma v. The State of Bihar motive behind the commission of the crime. It transpires from his statement that Neelam's late father Jang Bahadur Singh had no son and his house was in possession of his daughter Neelam. She was abducted in order to forcefully obtain the possession of the house belonging to her father. The second limb of motive stems from the pending litigation between A-1 to A-5 (appellants) on one side and deceased Neelam, her maternal grandfather and her two sisters on the other side. The accused persons had obtained letters of administration and probate of the Will left by late Jang Bahadur Singh from the competent court and the said order came to be challenged before the Patna High Court by the deceased, her maternal grandfather and younger sisters. In the said appeal, the Patna High Court had injuncted the accused persons from alienating any part of the property. The High Court also restrained the execution of the probate of the Will by restraining the delivery of possession of the property to the accused persons. Thus, deceased Neelam was residing in her father's house along with her husband and brother-in-law in order to retain the possession of the property. In this backdrop, the matter went for trial. BEFORE THE TRIAL COURT 7. The Trial Court, while acquitting A-6 and A-7, observed that the motive attributed for the commission of the crime was not attributable to the said two accused persons as no interest of theirs could be disclosed in the pending litigation. Further, it also found that A-6 was not named in the FIR registered upon the information supplied by PW18 and in his oral testimony, no statement of assault by A-6 and A-7 was given by him. It further held that no evidence surfaced during the trial to indicate the participation of A-6 and A-7 in the acts of abduction and commission of murder. 8. While convicting A-1 to A-5 on the charges under Sections 302/34 and 364/34 of IPC, the Trial Court primarily relied upon the oral testimonies of PW18/informant, PW2, PW4 and PW5. The motive for the commission of the offence was supplied by the pending legal dispute relating to the property belonging to late Jang Bahadur Singh. The Court also replied upon circumstantial evidence borne out from the testimonies of PW7 (maternal uncle of the de-ceased), PW3 (father-in-law of the deceased), PW23 (sister of the deceased) and PW13 (doctor) to arrive at the finding of guilt. 114 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports BEFORE THE HIGH COURT 9. A reading of the impugned judgment passed by the High Court suggests that the High Court carried out a fresh appreciation of evidence. The High Court firstly examined the question whether Neelam was actually residing in the house from which she was abducted. Relying upon the testimonies of PW7 (maternal uncle of deceased), PW18 (brother-in-law of deceased and informant) and PW21 (Investigating Officer), the Court concluded that Neelam was indeed residing in the said house. In doing so, the Court discarded the fact that the other independent occupants of the house such as Ram Chabila Singh, his son, Kumud Ranjan Singh etc. did not come in support of the said fact. To overcome this deficiency, the Court relied upon the statements of PW21 and PW23 (sister of deceased) that some make-up articles were found in a bag lying in the room, which was suggestive of the fact that a woman was residing in the said room. 10. In further consideration, the High Court excluded the evidence of PW5 for the reason that his presence at the place of incident was doubtful. For, PW5 deposed that he was heading towards his home from Deoghar and on the way from Lakhisarai to Simaltalla, he stopped at Sikandra Chowk along with PW2 and PW4. It was at this point that they heard the hulla and ended up witnessing the commission of offence. The High Court took note of the fact that while going from Deoghar to Simaltalla, Lakhisarai and Ghogsha would come first and thus, there was no reason for PW5 to come all the way to Sikandra Chowk if he was going to his home in Ghogsha as he could have directly proceeded from Lakhisarai to Ghogsha. Nevertheless, the High Court duly relied upon the evidence of PW2, PW4 and PW18 as well as on circumstantial evidence comprising of the testimonies of PW23, PW13 (doctor) and absence of suitable explanation in the statements of accused persons under Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 19734 as regards the fatal injuries suffered by the deceased. Thus, the High Court upheld the finding of guilt of A-1 to A-5. 11. As regards A-6 and A-7, the High Court reversed the finding of acquittal of the Trial Court into that of conviction. Primarily, the High 4 Hereinafter referred as \"CrPC\" [2024] 10 S.C.R. 115 Vijay Singh @ Vijay Kr. Sharma v. The State of Bihar Court observed that the said two accused persons were acquitted on the basis of the exonerating testimony of PW5 and the same cannot be sustained as the testimony of PW5 has been excluded by the High Court in appeal. Further, the Court held that the testimonies of PW2, PW4 and PW18 were consistent regarding the participation of A-6 and A-7 and thus, they were convicted for the commission of the offences under Sections 364 and 302 of IPC read with Section 34 of IPC. The applicability of Section 34 IPC was based on the fact that A-6 and A-7 had confined PW18 near the well in order to eliminate any chances of resistance in the acts committed by the other five accused persons. SUBMISSIONS 12. On behalf of A-6 and A-7, it is submitted that there was no motive for the said accused persons to have indulged in the commission of the offence in question. The motive, if any, existed only for the remaining five accused persons who were interested in the outcome of the pending litigation between the parties. It is further contended that the High Court ought not to have entered into the exercise of re-appreciation of the entire evidence without finding any infirmity in the view taken by the Trial Court. To buttress this submission, it is submitted that since the view taken by the Trial Court was a possible view, it could not have been disturbed by the High Court in appeal. In this regard, reliance has been placed upon the decisions of this Court in State of Goa v. Sanjay Thakran,5 Chandrappa v. State of Karnataka,6 Nepal Singh v. State of Haryana,7 Kashiram v. State of M.P.,8 Labh Singh v. State of Punjab9 and Suratlal v. State of M.P.10 13. It is further submitted that no reliance could be placed upon the testimonies of PW2 and PW4 as their presence at the spot was doubtful. Further, if they were 400 yards away when hue and cry was raised, they could not have seen A-6 taking away PW18 towards the well as the said fact took place prior to the hue and cry. It is further 5 [2007] 3 SCR 507 : (2007) 3 SCC 755 6 [2007] 2 SCR 630 : (2007) 4 SCC 415 7 [2009] 6 SCR 982 : (2009) 12 SCC 351 8 [2001] 4 Supp. SCR 263 : (2002) 1 SCC 71 9 (1976) 1 SCC 181 10 (1982) 1 SCC 488 116 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports submitted that in the FIR, no pistol was assigned to A-6, whereas, the said fact was brought forward at the time of evidence. The appellants have also raised a question regarding the time of incident on the basis of medical evidence. It is stated that the post-mortem report indicated that half-digested food was found in the stomach of the deceased, whereas, the informant PW18 deposed that the incident took place immediately after dinner. If such was the case, the death ought to have occurred around 1-2 AM in the intervening night of 30.08.1985-31.08.1985, but the post-mortem report, based on the post-mortem conducted at around 05:30 PM on 31.08.1985, indicated that death took place about 24 hours ago and thus, the time of death was around 05:00 PM on 30.08.1985 and not 10:00 PM, as alleged. 14. The appellants have also submitted that the prosecution has not proved that the deceased was actually residing in the concerned house at Simaltalla. 15. Per contra, it is submitted on behalf of the State that mere non- examination of some independent witnesses shall not be fatal to the case of the prosecution. Reliance has been placed upon the decision of this Court in Rai Saheb & ors. v. State of Haryana11 to contend that at times, independent witnesses may not come forward due to fear. It is further submitted that the High Court has correctly appreciated the evidence in order to arrive at the finding of guilt of the accused persons. It is further submitted that the testimonies of PW2, PW4 and PW18 are consistent and the High Court has correctly placed reliance upon their testimonies. As regards motive as well, it is submitted that the evidence is sufficient to reveal motive for the commission of the crime. 16. We have heard learned counsels for the appellants as well as for the State. We have also carefully examined the record. DISCUSSION 17. In light of the rival contentions raised by the parties, the principal issue that arises before the Court is whether the finding of guilt of the appellants arrived at by the High Court is sustainable in light of the evidence on record. As a corollary of this issue, it also needs 11 (1994) Supp.1 SCC 74 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 117 Vijay Singh @ Vijay Kr. Sharma v. The State of Bihar to be examined whether the approach of the High Court was in line with the settled law for reversing an acquittal into conviction in a criminal appeal. 18. After two rounds of litigation before the Trial Court and the High Court, it is fairly certain the case is to be examined only with respect to the offences under Sections 364 and 302 of IPC read with Section 34 IPC. With respect to the offence under Section 364 IPC, the case of the prosecution is based on direct oral evidence, and with respect to the offence under Section 302 IPC, the case of the prosecution is essentially based on circumstantial evidence as no direct evidence of the commission of murder could be collected. However, it is quite evident that the offence of murder was committed after the commission of the offence of abduction. There is a sequential relationship between the two offences and thus, in order to set up a case for the commission of the offence of murder, it is necessary to prove the commission of the offence of abduction by the accused persons/appellants. For, the chain, in a case based on circumstantial evidence, must be complete and consistent. 19. In order to prove the offence under Section 364 IPC, the prosecution has relied upon the oral testimonies of four eye witnesses - PW- 2, PW-4, PW-5 and PW-18. Their testimonies have been assailed on various counts. The appellants have termed the said witnesses as interested and chance witnesses. The former charge originates from the fact that the witnesses were related to the deceased, and the latter charge originates from the fact that the witnesses had no rea-son to be present at the place of offence and they just appeared unexpectedly as a matter of chance. Let us examine both the aspects. We may first examine the testimonies of the witnesses independently, without going into their relationship with the deceased. 20. The informant PW18 has deposed that he was standing near a rickshaw outside his house and the deceased was sleeping inside the house. PW18 was standing along with three independent persons namely, Doman Tenti, Daso Mistry and Soordas. The seven accused persons came along with 15 other persons. A-6 and A-7, along with unknown persons, first came to PW18 and took him away towards the well and confined him there. Thereafter, the remaining accused persons, along with other unknown assailants, entered the house wherein the deceased was sleeping. Interestingly, as 118 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports per the version of the informant, the house was bolted from inside and was opened by a tenant namely Kumud Ranjan Singh. The problem with the informant's version begins from this point itself. As per his version, the first eye witnesses of the incident ought to have been Doman Tenti, Daso Mistry, Soordas and Kumud Ranjan Singh. One person, namely Soordas, was stated to be blind and thus, he may be excluded. Nevertheless, the prosecution ought to have examined the three natural witnesses of the incident namely, Doman Tenti, Daso Mistry and Kumud Ranjan Singh. There is no explanation for non-examination of the natural eye witnesses. The version becomes more doubtful when it is examined in light of his statement that he could not prevent the accused persons as A-6 had threatened him with a pistol. In the FIR, no pistol has been attributed to A-6, whereas in the statement recorded before the Trial Court, this fact was introduced for the first time, which is indicative of improvement. Furthermore, PW18 got it recorded in the FIR that A-6 and others had assaulted him with fists and slaps, but the said fact was not deposed before the Trial Court in his examination in chief. The discrepancy assumes greater seriousness in light of the fact that no pistol has been recovered from any of the accused persons and if the factum of branding of pistol is un-der the cloud of doubt, the entire conduct of PW18 becomes doubtful and unnatural, as he did not try to prevent the accused persons from entering the premises or from abducting the deceased or from taking away the deceased on their shoulders in front of his eyes as he was the brother-in-law of the deceased. 21. The other eye witnesses, PW2, PW4 and PW5, de-posed collectively in favour of the prosecution as they had arrived at the scene of crime together. At around 10:00 PM on the fateful night, the said eye witnesses happened to be present at Sikandra Chowk and they heard some hue and cry at the house of the deceased. The witnesses were coming together in a jeep from Lakhisarai and were going towards their home in Ghogsha village, the village wherein the deceased was married and also the native village of PW18/informant. PW2 was the driver of PW4. The testimo-nies of the said PWs have made it clear that while coming from Lakhisarai to Sikandra Chowk, Ghogsha came first, followed by Lohanda and Simaltalla. In such circumstances, their presence at Sikandra Chowk at 10:00 PM must be explained to the satisfaction of the Court. For, if they were going [2024] 10 S.C.R. 119 Vijay Singh @ Vijay Kr. Sharma v. The State of Bihar to their village, there was no occasion for them to come to Simaltalla as it did not fall on their way. But no such ex-planation is forthcoming from the material on record. 22. Interestingly, this lacuna was duly noted by the High Court with respect to PW5 as there was no reason for him to be present at Sikandra Chowk at the time of incident and his testimony was excluded. However, the same logic was not extended to the testimony of PW4 as well, as it was equally improbable for him to be present at Sikandra Chowk at 10:00 PM on the date of incident. His visit to Sikandra Chowk was not necessitated for going to his village. Even otherwise, since the three eye witnesses were similarly placed as per their own version, the rejection of testimony of one witness ought to have raised a natural doubt on the testimonies of the other two witnesses unless they had a better explanation. However, no such doubt was entertained by the High Court and the impugned judgment offers no explanation for the same. In light of their own testimonies, none of the three eye witnesses were required to visit Sikandra Chowk or Simaltalla for going to their village. 23. The testimonies of the eye witnesses are also impeachable in light of the other evidence on record. PW21 was the investigating officer in the case and he had examined the aforesaid PWs as eye witnesses of the incident. The version put forth by the eye witnesses meets a serious doubt when examined in light of the evidence of DW3 and DW4, the concerned Deputy Superintendent and Superintendent of Police respectively who had supervised the investigation of the present case. Both these officers were examined as defence witnesses on behalf of the appellants. As per the supervision notes prepared by DW3 during the course of investigation, PW2 and PW4 got to know about the incident only when PW18 came running to them after the incident. PW2, at that time, was sitting in a hotel with Umesh Singh to have 'prasad'. Similarly, the evidence of DW4 indicates that on the date of incident, at around 10:00 PM, PW4 was coming from Lakhisarai in his jeep and he saw six-seven persons fleeing away in a jeep and he identified them as the accused persons. Thus, PW4 entered the scene after the commission of offence and he did not witness the act of abduction. The testimony of PW2 strengthens the doubt as he deposed that when they reached the police station after the incident with PW18, neither him nor PW4 in-formed the IO that they had directly seen the incident. The stark difference 120 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports between the versions put forth by the PW21 and DW3/DW4 raises serious concerns regarding the fairness of investigation conducted by PW21 and it is a reasonable possibility that the eye witnesses were brought in to create a fool proof case. The evidence of DW3 and DW4, both senior officers who had exercised supervision over the investigation conducted by PW21, indicates that the so-called eye witnesses of the incident were actually accessories after the fact and not accessories to the fact. 24. The second limb of the objection against the testimonies of the eye witnesses is that none of the eye witnesses is an independent witness of fact. Ordinarily, there is no rule of law to discard the testimonies of the witnesses merely because they were known to the victim or belonged to her family. For, an offence may be committed in circumstances that only the family members are present at the place of occurrence in natural course. However, the present case does not fall in such category. In the facts of the present case, the natural presence of the eye witnesses at the place of occurrence is under serious doubt, as discussed above, and for unexplained reasons, the naturally present public persons were not examined as witnesses in the matter. The non-examination of natural witnesses such as Doman Tenti, Daso Mistry, Soordas, Kumud Ranjan Singh and many other neighbours who admittedly came out of their houses to witness the offence, coupled with the fact that the projected eye witnesses failed to explain their presence at the place of occurrence, renders the entire version of the prosecution as improbable and unreliable. The eye witnesses, being family members, were apparently approached by PW18 who in-formed them about the incident and later, their versions were fabricated to make the case credible. Notably, when the version put forth by the interested witnesses comes under a shadow of doubt, the rule of prudence demands that the independent public witnesses must be examined and corroborating material must be gathered. More so, when public witnesses were readily available and the offence has not taken place in the bounds of closed walls. 25. Pertinently, the conduct of the eye witnesses also ap-pears to be unnatural considering that they were all relatives of the deceased. Firstly, PW18 did not try to prevent the ab-duction. Even if it is believed that he was held against a pistol, the statement regarding the existence of pistol comes as an improvement from his first information given to the police, as already noted above. Nonetheless, it is admitted [2024] 10 S.C.R. 121 Vijay Singh @ Vijay Kr. Sharma v. The State of Bihar that PW2, PW4 and PW5 came in a jeep and they saw the accused persons leaving with Neelam after abducting her. It is also admitted that they had identified the accused persons, who were essentially the relatives of the eye witnesses. In such circumstances, as per natural human conduct, the least that they could have done was to follow the accused persons in their jeep. They admittedly had a ready vehicle with them. Despite so, there was no such attempt on their part, so much so that the dead body of Neelam was not even discovered until the following morning as none of the eye witnesses had any clue as to where the accused persons had taken away the deceased after abducting her. 26. One crucial foundational fact in the present case is that the deceased was residing in her father's house at Simaltalla. Although, the Trial Court and High Court have not doubted the said fact, we have our reservations regarding the same. In addition to the statements of PW18 (informant), PW23 (sister of deceased) and PW7 (maternal uncle of deceased), no other witness has deposed to prove the factum of residence. The admitted evidence on record sufficiently indicates that various other tenants were residing in the same house, including Kumud Ranjan Singh, Education Officer Ram Chabila Singh along with his daughter and son. 27. The investigating officer PW21 had inspected the house and no direct material, except some make-up articles, could be gathered so as to indicate that Neelam was actually residing there. Admittedly, another woman namely, Chando Devi (sister of Ram Chabila Singh) was also residing in the same portion of the house. The High Court did take note of this fact but explained it away by observing that since Chando Devi was a widow, the make-up articles could not have belonged to her as there was no need for her to put on make-up being a widow. In our opinion, the observation of the High Court is not only legally untenable but also highly objectionable. A sweeping observation of this nature is not commensurate with the sensitivity and neutrality expected from a court of law, specifically when the same is not made out from any evidence on record. 28. Be that as it may, mere presence of certain make-up articles cannot be a conclusive proof of the fact that the deceased was residing in the said house, especially when another woman was admittedly residing there. Furthermore, if Neelam was indeed residing there, her other belongings such as clothes etc. ought to have been found 122 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports in the house and even if not so, the other residents of the same house could have come forward to depose in support of the said fact. 29. Notably, certain clothes such as two sarees, two blouses and two petticoats were recovered along with the dead body of the deceased. The prosecution version is that the accused persons had taken away the said clothes from the house of the deceased while abducting her. There is absolutely no explanation for the said conduct on the part of the accused persons. It is difficult to understand as to why the accused persons would take her clothes along while abducting her. On the contrary, this fact actually serves the case of the prosecution in proving that the de-ceased was actually residing at the house in Simaltalla. The clothes appear to have been planted along with the dead body in order to support the fact of actual residence of the deceased at her father's house in Simaltalla. In light of the material on record, it could be concluded that no material whatsoever could be found at the house of Jang Bahadur Singh to directly indicate that the deceased was residing there. The make-up articles were linked with the deceased on the basis of a completely unacceptable reasoning and without any corroborative material. The prosecution has failed to examine even one cohabitant to prove the said fact. Furthermore, no personal belongings of the deceased, such as clothes, footwear, utensils etc., could be found in the entire house. Therefore, we are not inclined to believe that the deceased was actually residing in the house at Simaltalla. In the same breath, we may also note that even for PW18, no material was found in the said house to indicate that he was in fact residing there. Apart from his own statement, no witness has come forward to depose that the informant was a resident of the said house. The prosecution has not spotted any room in the entire house wherein PW18 was residing and thus, his own presence at the place of occurrence is doubtful. 30. The appellants have also raised certain objections with respect to the time of death. The discrepancy has been flagged in light of the post mortem report, based on the post-mortem conducted at around 5:30 PM on 31.08.1985, which indicates that death took place around 24 hours ago. It indicates that the time of death must have been around 5:00 PM on 30.08.1985, which is contrary to the evidence of PW18 that the incident took place around 10:00 PM on 30.08.1985. A post mortem report is generally not considered as conclusive evidence of the facts mentioned in the re-port regarding the cause of death, [2024] 10 S.C.R. 123 Vijay Singh @ Vijay Kr. Sharma v. The State of Bihar time of death etc. It could always be corroborated with other direct evidence on record such as ocular evidence of the eye witnesses. However, when there is no other credible evidence on record to contradict the report, the facts stated in the post mortem report are generally taken as true. In the present matter, the evidence of the eye witnesses has been declared as wholly unreliable including on the aspect of time of death. Thus, there is no reason to doubt the post mortem report and the findings therein. 31. At this stage, we may also note that the approach of the High Court in reversing the acquittal of A-6 and A-7 was not in line with the settled law pertaining to reversal of acquittals. The Trial Court had acquitted the said two accused persons on the basis of a thorough appreciation of evidence and the High Court merely observed that their acquittal was based on the improbable statement of PW5 and since the evidence of PW5 stood excluded from the record, there was no reason left for the acquittal of A-6 and A-7. Pertinently, the High Court did not arrive at any finding of illegality or perversity in the opinion of the Trial Court on that count. Furthermore, it did not arrive at any positive finding of involvement of the said two accused persons within the sphere of common intention with the remaining accused persons. Equally, the exclusion of the evidence of PW5, without explaining as to how the evidence of PW2 and PW4 was not liable to be excluded in the same manner, was in-correct and erroneous. 32. We do not intend to say that the High Court could not have appreciated the evidence on record in its exercise of appellate powers. No doubt, the High Court was well within its powers to do so. However, in order to reverse a finding of acquittal, a higher threshold is required. For, the presumption of innocence operating in favour of an accused through-out the trial gets concretized with a finding of acquittal by the Trial Court. Thus, such a finding could not be reversed merely because the possibility of an alternate view was alive. Rather, the view taken by the Trial Court must be held to be completely unsustainable and not a probable view. The High Court, in the impugned judgment, took a cursory view of the matter and reversed the acquittal of A-6 and A-7 without arriving at any finding of illegality or perversity or impossibility of the Trial Court's view or non-appreciation of evidence by the Trial Court.\n\n124 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 33. We may usefully refer to the exposition of law in Sanjeev v. State of H.P.,12 wherein this Court summarized the position in this regard and observed as follows: \"7. It is well settled that: 7.1. While dealing with an appeal against acquittal, the reasons which had weighed with the trial court in acquitting the accused must be dealt with, in case the appellate court is of the view that the acquittal rendered by the trial court deserves to be upturned (see Vijay Mohan Singh v. State of Karnataka13, Anwar Ali v. State of H.P.14) 7.2. With an order of acquittal by the trial court, the normal presumption of innocence in a criminal matter gets reinforced (see Atley v. State of U.P.15) 7.3. If two views are possible from the evidence on record, the appellate court must be extremely slow in interfering with the appeal against acquittal (see Sambasivan v. State of Kerala16)\" 34. Having observed that the case of the prosecution is full of glaring doubts as regards the offence of abduction, we may briefly note and reiterate that the offence of murder is entirely dependent on circumstantial evidence. Although, the post mortem report indicates that the death of the deceased was unnatural and the commission of murder cannot be ruled out. But there is no direct evidence on record to prove the commission of murder by the accused persons. The link of causation between the accused persons and the alleged offence is conspicuously missing. The circumstantial evidence emanating from the facts surrounding the offence of abduction, such as the testimonies of eye witnesses, has failed to meet the test of proof and cannot be termed as proved in the eyes of law. Therefore, the foundation of circumstantial evidence having fallen down, no inference could be drawn from it to infer the commission 12 (2022) 6 SCC 294 13 (2019) 5 SCC 436 14 (2020) 10 SCC 166 15 AIR 1955 SC 807 16 [1998] 3 SCR 280 : (1998) 5 SCC 412 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 125 Vijay Singh @ Vijay Kr. Sharma v. The State of Bihar of the offence under Section 302 IPC by the accused persons. It is trite law that in a case based on circumstantial evidence, the chain of evidence must be complete and must give out an inescapable conclusion of guilt. In the pre-sent case, the prosecution case is far from meeting that standard. 35. As regards motive, we may suffice to say that motive has a bearing only when the evidence on record is sufficient to prove the ingredients of the offences under consideration. Without the proof of foundational facts, the case of the prosecution cannot succeed on the presence of motive alone. Moreover, the motive in the present matter could operate both ways. The accused persons and the eyewitnesses belong to the same family and the presence of a property related dispute is evident. In a hypothetical sense, both the sides could benefit from implicating the other. In such circumstances, placing reliance upon motive alone could be a double-edged sword. We say no more. 36. The above analysis indicates that the prosecution has failed to discharge its burden to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. The reasonable doubts, indicated above, are irreconcilable and strike at the foundation of the prosecution's case. Thus, the appellants are liable to be acquitted of all the charges. 37. In light of the foregoing discussion, we hereby conclude that the findings of conviction arrived at by the Trial Court and the High Court are not sustainable. Moreover, the High Court erred in reversing the acquittal of A-6 and A-7. Accordingly, the impugned judgment as well as the judgment rendered by the Trial Court (to the extent of conviction of A-1 to A-5) are set aside, and all seven accused persons (appellants) are hereby acquitted of all the charges levelled upon them. The appellants are directed to be released forthwith, if lying in custody. 38. The captioned appeals stand disposed of in terms of this judgment. Interim application(s), if any, shall also stand disposed of. No costs. Result of the Case: Appeals disposed of. †Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain", "2024_10_126_149_EN": "[2024] 10 S.C.R. 126 : 2024 INSC 748 V. Vincent Velankanni v.

Judgment / Order of the Supreme Court Judgment Mehta, J. Civil Appeal No(s). 8617 of 2013 1. The instant appeal by special leave takes exception to the judgment dated 10th October, 2011 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Madras in Writ Petition,1 whereby the Division Bench of the High Court accepted the writ petition2 preferred by the private respondents herein3 and reversed the judgment dated 24th December, 2010 passed by the Central Administrative Tribunal, Madras Bench4 in Original 1 Writ Petition No. 583 of 2011 2 Ibid 3 Respondent Nos. 3, 4 and 5 4 'CAT', hereafter\n\n[2024] 10 S.C.R. 129 V. Vincent Velankanni v. The Union of India and Others Application5 preferred by the private respondents herein. The CAT had rejected the Original Application,6 challenging the proposed action of revision and fixation of their seniority in the Engine Factory, Avadi, Chennai.7 2. The brief facts in a nutshell, relevant and essential for the disposal of the instant appeal are noted hereinbelow. 3. The appellant and the private respondents were engaged on semi-skilled posts such as Fitters and Machinists in respondent No.2-Factory. A common select list of candidates based on merit was issued by the General Manager of respondent No.2-Factory in the year 1995 wherein the appellant herein was placed at a higher position than the private respondents. An appointment order dated 17th January, 1996 was issued in the favour of the appellant for the post of 'Fitter General(semi-skilled)' in respondent No.2-Factory. He was initially placed on probation for a period of two years which was further extended for a period of six months w.e.f. 17th January, 1998. The appellant satisfactorily completed the probation period on 16th July, 1998. Thereafter, he was promoted to the 'Skilled' grade on 6th January, 1999. 4. A draft seniority list dated 28th July, 2006 was issued by respondent No.2-Factory, whereby the seniority of 'Fitters' was fixed as per their respective dates of promotion to the skilled grade and the appellant was placed at a lower position than the private respondents. 5. Aggrieved of the draft seniority list,8 the appellant submitted a representation dated 13th November, 2006 to the General Manager of respondent No.2-Factory seeking necessary amendments in the draft seniority list and to fix his position appropriately and thereafter, to publish a final seniority list. The General Manager rejected the aforesaid representation submitted by the appellant vide communication dated 9th July, 2007, observing that his seniority had been fixed from the date of holding the skilled grade, and thus the position of the appellant in the seniority list was not liable to be altered. 5 Original Application No. 318 of 2009 6 Ibid 7 'respondent No. 2-Factory', hereafter 8 Dated 28th July, 2006 130 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 6. Being aggrieved, the appellant preferred Original Application No. 821 of 2007 before the CAT challenging the draft seniority list dated 28th July, 2006. 7. Another employee, namely, Mr. P. Kumaresan who was appointed as a Mechanist in respondent No.2-Factory in January 1996, also filed Original Application No. 831 of 2007, before the CAT, wherein Mr. P. Kumaresan also claimed that he had to be placed at the 6th position instead of the 27th position as set out in the draft seniority list. Original Application9 preferred by Mr. P. Kumaresan came to be allowed by the CAT holding that the seniority fixed in the draft list was incorrect. The CAT noted that respondent No.2-Factory had allowed the promotion to the juniors of Mr. P. Kumaresan on the ground that he was still undergoing the extended period of probation. The CAT held that it is settled law that once the extended period of probation is completed, the employee should be confirmed in service from the date of initial selection and should be assigned the original rank in the seniority list. Thus, once the extended period of probation came to an end and the employee was found suitable, he had to be confirmed in service, promoted with seniority and all consequential benefits to the next grade with reference to the date of initial appointment. 8. The CAT allowed Original Application No. 821 of 2007 preferred by the appellant herein vide order dated 23rd January, 2009, basing its decision on the order passed in Original Application No. 831 of 2007 considering the fact that both the workers were identically employed in respondent No.2-Factory and directed that the appellant was entitled to be considered for his claim of seniority and directed the respondents10 to revise the seniority list accordingly. 9. The private respondents herein filed Original Application No. 318 of 2009 before CAT against the proposed action of revision of seniority list and promotions in accordance with the order dated 23rd January, 2009 passed in the Original Application No. 821 of 2007 filed by the appellant. The said Original Application11 was dismissed by CAT vide order dated 24th December, 2010 while granting the liberty to 9 Original Application No. 831 of 2007 10 Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 11 Original Application No.318 of 2009 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 131 V. Vincent Velankanni v. The Union of India and Others the applicants therein(private respondents herein) to file a review application for assailing the orders passed in Original Application No. 831 of 2007 and Original Application No. 821 of 2007. 10. However, private respondents herein rather than filing a review application, chose to assail the orders passed by the CAT by preferring a Writ Petition12 before the Madras High Court which came to be allowed vide order dated 10th October, 2011. The Union of India13 and respondent No. 2-Factory were directed by the High Court to restore the seniority of the writ petitioners(private respondents herein), holding that the writ petitioners are senior to the appellant herein, both as per the date of initial appointment and also in the promotional post of skilled grade. The High Court held that an employee selected in the semi-skilled grade is required to complete the probation period satisfactorily and has to pass the requisite trade test prescribed for the post before he can be confirmed and promoted to the skilled grade. Due to the extension of the probation period of the respondents in the Writ Petition No.583 of 2011(including the appellant herein), they were required to be placed below the persons who were promoted to the skilled grade earlier to them. The High Court held that in the skilled grade, the writ petitioners(private respondents herein) were senior to the third respondent(appellant herein). It was also held that the promotions to the skilled grade and the highly skilled grade were carried out in the years 1998 and 2003, respectively but the third respondent (appellant herein) chose to file the Original Application14 in the year 2007 and no reason was forthcoming for the gross delay. The relevant extract from the High Court's judgment dated 10th October, 2011 is reproduced hereinbelow: - \"7. A mere reading of the counter affidavit would show that the probation of the third respondent in W.P. No. 583 of 2011 was extended by six months and for the third respondent in W.P. No. 584 of 2011, it was extended by three months by virtue of their failure to complete probation of two years and to pass the required trade test prescribed for the posts. Accordingly, the third respondent in W.P. No. 583 of 12 Writ Petition No. 583 of 2011 13 Respondent No. 1 14 Original Application No. 821 of 2007\n\n132 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 2011 was placed in the skilled grade only with effect from 6.1.1999 and third respondent in W.P. No. 584 of 2011 was promoted only with effect from 5.10.1998 whereas the petitioners in both the petitions were promoted to the skilled grade on 3.7.1998. 8. It is not in dispute that the Semi-Skilled grade is only has to complete the probation period satisfactorily and pass the requisite trade tests prescribed for the posts. In the present case, it is clear that due to extension of the probation period, the respondents were placed below the persons who were promoted to Skilled grade earlier than them. Even if the date of appointment is taken into consideration, the petitioners are seniors to the third respondent in these petitions. 9. That apart, the petitioners were promoted to the skilled grade in the year 1998 and to the highly skilled grade in the year 2003. But the third respondent in these petitions have chosen to file the original applications only in the year 2007 and no reason is forthcoming for the delay. 10. In view of the counter affidavit filed by the Department which is in favour of the petitioners and the fact that the petitioners are seniors to the third respondent in these petitions both as per the date of initial appointment and also the date of promotion to the skilled grade, we are of the view that revising the seniority list at the instance of the third respondent in the Writ Petitions in the guise of implementing the order of the Tribunal, is illegal. Therefore, in our considered opinion, the order of the Tribunal is to be interfered with. 11. For the aforesaid reasons, the writ petitions are allowed and the order of the Tribunal is set aside. The respondents 1 and 2 are directed to restore the seniority of the petitioners confirming their original date of promotion to the Highly Skilled Grade. After revising the seniority, the respondents are further directed to consider the case of the petitioners for subsequent promotion on par with their juniors.\" (quoted verbatim from the paper book) [2024] 10 S.C.R. 133 V. Vincent Velankanni v. The Union of India and Others The judgment dated 10th October, 2011 passed by the Division Bench of the High Court is the subject matter of challenge in the instant appeal. Submissions on behalf of the appellant: 11. Learned counsel appearing for the appellant urged that the High Court premised its findings on a totally erroneous reasoning that the challenge laid by the appellant to the draft seniority list was delayed and that the private respondents herein(writ petitioners) were senior to the appellant as on the date of initial appointment. 12. Learned counsel contended that the draft seniority list in the appellant's cadre was published in the year 2006 for the first time after the appointment of the appellant as well as the private respondents. Immediately on receiving the draft seniority list, the appellant herein made a representation against the same and when a favourable decision was not forthcoming, he approached the CAT for challenging the validity thereof. He submitted that the finding of the High Court that the private respondents herein(writ petitioners) were senior to the appellant as on the date of initial appointment is totally against the record. 13. He further urged that the extant rules do not provide that the promotion from Fitter(semi-skilled) to Fitter(skilled) would be dependent on passing the trade test. Thus, as soon as the appellant completed the probation period, his services would have to be confirmed and reckoned from the date of initial appointment, and by virtue thereof, the appellant would be entitled to be placed above the private respondents in the order of seniority. 14. Learned counsel submitted that the period spent during training/ probation has to be reckoned for computation of length of service and the same cannot be excluded while assigning seniority to an employee. In support of his arguments, learned counsel placed reliance on the judgment of this Court in the case of L. Chandrakishore Singh v. State of Haryana.15 15. He further submitted that the movement of the employee from semi- skilled to skilled grade tantamounts to confirmation/ upgradation and 15 AIR 1975 SC 613\n\n134 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports not a promotion. In support of this contention, reliance was placed on the judgment of this Court in the case of BSNL v. R. Santhakumari Velusamy.16 16. Learned counsel also placed reliance on the Office Memorandum17 dated 4th November,1992, issued by the Government of India, Department of Personnel and Training, which was in force at the time when the appellant and the private respondents were appointed, wherein, it is provided: - \"Seniority for Promotion Order effective from 4th November, 1992 [Government of India, Department of Personnel and Training, Office Memorandum No. 20011/5/90-Estt. (D), dated the 4th November, 1992] Seniority to be determined by the order of merit indicated at the time of initial appointment.- The seniority of Government servants is determined in accordance with the general principles of seniority contained in M.Η.Α., Ο.Μ. No. 9/11155-RPS, dated the 22nd December, 1959 (See Section II). One of the basic principles enunciated in the said OM is that, seniority follows confirmation and consequently permanent officers in each grade shall rank senior to those who are officiating in that grade. 2. This principle has been coming under judicial scrutiny in a number of cases in the past; the last important judgment being the one delivered by the Supreme Court on 2-5-1990, in the case of Class II Direct Recruits Engineering Officers' Association v. State of Maharashtra. In Para. 47 (A) of the said judgment, the Supreme Court has held that once an incumbent is appointed to a post according to rule, his seniority has to be counted from the date of his appointment and not-according to the date of his confirmation. 3. The general principle of seniority mentioned above has been examined in the light of the judicial pronouncement 16 [2011] 14 SCR 502 : (2011) 9 SCC 510 17 'OM', hereafter [2024] 10 S.C.R. 135 V. Vincent Velankanni v. The Union of India and Others referred to above and it has been decided that seniority may be delinked from confirmation as per the directive of the Supreme Court in Para, 47 (A) of its judgment, dated 2-5-1990. Accordingly, in modification of the General Principle 3, proviso to General Principle 4 and proviso to General Principle 5 (i) contained in O.M. No. 9/11155-RPS, dated the 22nd December, 1959 and Para. 2.3 of O.M., dated the 3rd July, 1986, it has been decided that the seniority of a person regularly appointed to a post according to rule would be determined by the order of merit indicated at the time of initial appointment and not according to the date of confirmation. 4. These orders shall take effect from the date of issue of this Office Memorandum. Seniority already determined according to the existing principles on the date of issue of these orders will not be reopened even if in some cases seniority has already been challenged or is in dispute and it will continue to be determined on the basis of the principles already existing prior to the date of issue of these orders.\" (emphasis supplied) He thus urged that the seniority of a person regularly appointed would have to be reckoned based on the merit indicated at the time of the initial appointment and not as per the date of confirmation. To support this submission, he also placed reliance on the Constitution Bench decision of this Court in Direct Recruit Class II Engg. Officers' Assn. v. State of Maharashtra.18 He thus implored the Court to accept the appeal, set aside the impugned judgment rendered by the High Court, and restore the judgment of the CAT. Submissions on behalf of the respondents: 17. Per contra, learned counsel appearing for respondent Nos. 1 and 2 submitted that the appellant was appointed as Fitter General(semi- 18 [1990] 2 SCR 900 : (1990) 2 SCC 715\n\n136 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports skilled) on 17th January, 1996. The semi-skilled grade is only a trainee grade and in order to be confirmed in service and for being promoted to the skilled grade, the employee would have to complete the probation period satisfactorily and pass the requisite trade test prescribed for promotion to the skilled grade. Only on passing the trade test, the employee would qualify for a permanent status and promotion to the skilled grade. 18. He further submitted that it is a settled law that in cases where there are no rules governing the field, it is the placement in the initial merit list that will decide the seniority, however, if the rules are in vogue, then the same will prevail. In this regard, he placed reliance on Suresh Chandra Jha v. State of Bihar and Others.19 19. Learned counsel for the respondents placed reliance on Statutory Regulatory Order20 No. 185 of 1994 dated 1st November, 1994 to urge that any appointment in the industrial establishment is done against the skilled grade and hence, the period spent in the semi- skilled grade till completion of probation period and qualifying the prescribed trade test for promotion to the skilled grade is considered only as a trainee grade. Resultantly, the seniority/merit position at the time of induction in the trainee grade would have no bearing on the inter se seniority of the employees which would have to be reckoned from the date the employee is confirmed and promoted to the skilled grade upon completing the probation period and clearing the trade test. 20. He further placed reliance upon the Government Order21 dated 24th December, 2002 issued by the Ordinance Factory Board, Ministry of Defence, Government of India, which was issued to clarify the counting of seniority in trades mentioned in SRO No. 185 of 1994 applicable to the Industrial Establishments and urged that the said GO clarifies beyond the pale of doubt that the semi-skilled grade is a trainee grade and the seniority will be counted from the date of promotion to the skilled grade and not from the date of induction/ entry in the semi-skilled grade. 19 [2006] Supp. 8 SCR 831 : (2007) 1 SCC 405 20 'SRO', hereafter 21 'GO', hereafter [2024] 10 S.C.R. 137 V. Vincent Velankanni v. The Union of India and Others 21. Learned counsel pointed out that the two years' probation period of the appellant was extended by six months w.e.f. 17th January, 1998, and the appellant could complete the probation period only on 16th July, 1998. Subsequently, upon passing the trade test, he was promoted to the skilled grade w.e.f. 6th January, 1999. The appellant lost the seniority on account of his failure to complete probation in the period of two years and clearing the trade test whereas, the private respondents herein had completed probation in time and were found to be fit in the trade test and therefore, they were promoted to the skilled grade much before the appellant. Consequently, these employees i.e. private respondents herein were placed higher in seniority, as per clarification issued by Ordinance Factory Board vide GO dated 24th December, 2002. On these grounds, learned counsel for the respondents implored the Court to dismiss the appeal and affirm the order passed by the High Court. 22. Learned counsel for the private respondents herein22 adopted the submissions advanced by learned counsel for respondent Nos. 1 and 2. 23. We have given our thoughtful consideration to the submissions advanced at the bar by learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the impugned judgment and the material placed on record. Discussion and Conclusion: 24. The fact that the appellant and private respondents were inducted as semi-skilled grade employees in respondent No. 2-Factory in the year 1996 is not in dispute. The common select list dated 22nd November, 1995 is not placed on record by the parties. However, appellant filed an RTI,23 and the reply thereto dated 29th December, 2011 clearly shows that at the time of initial induction, appellant was placed at the 7th position, whereas the private respondents24 were placed at the 30th, 31st and 32nd positions, respectively in the select list based on merit. 22 Respondent Nos. 3, 4, and 5 23 Right to Information 24 Respondent Nos. 3, 4 and 5\n\n138 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 25. The Division Bench of the High Court in the impugned judgment dated 10th October, 2011 has recorded a categoric finding that even if the date of appointment is taken into consideration, the writ petitioners(private respondents herein) are senior to respondent No.3(appellant herein). This finding seems to be prima facie erroneous because admittedly, the appellant herein was placed at 7th position and the private respondents were placed at the 30th, 31st and 32nd positions in the order of merit, as borne out from the record. Further, in writ petition25 filed by the private respondents before the High Court and the counter affidavit filed by the respondents herein before this Court, there is no averment that these respondents were placed above to the appellant at the time of initial appointment. Rather the sole ground taken by the writ petitioners(private respondents herein) to oppose the prayer of the appellant was that the appellant was not able to complete his probation period and pass the trade test on time and thus, he was placed below the private respondents in the draft seniority list. 26. Before we adjudicate upon the issue of inter se seniority amongst the litigating parties, we find it necessary to comment on the appellant's approach towards filing his claim concerning his promotion in the highly skilled grade. 27. The appellant and the private respondents faced a common selection process and were appointed in the semi-skilled grade in the year 1996. The private respondents herein were promoted to the skilled grade on 11th January, 1998 and further promoted to the highly skilled grade on 20th May, 2003. On the other hand, the appellant was promoted to the skilled grade on 17th July, 1998(after completing his extended probation period of 6 months and clearing the mandatory trade test). Considering that the private respondents were promoted to highly skilled grade in May, 2003, the appellant in the normal course should also have been promoted to highly skilled grade by the end of the year 2003. However, as per the factual matrix, he was promoted to the highly skilled grade after around 5 years i.e. on 26th March, 2008. A tabular chart depicting the date of appointment and the date of promotion to skilled and highly skilled grade is placed below: - 25 Writ Petition No. 583 of 2011 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 139 V.

(Appellant) 17.1.1998 by order dated 5.2.1998 28. The draft seniority list was published on 28th July, 2006. The appellant never questioned the denial of promotion to the highly skilled grade, till much after the publication of the draft seniority list. Admittedly, co-employees who were below the appellant in the select list of the year 1996 were promoted in the intervening period without any objection being raised by the appellant. After the publication of the draft seniority list in the year 2006, he chose to challenge the same and to consider his promotion to highly skilled grade with effect from 20th May, 2003 by filing an Original Application26 before CAT only in the year 2007. Thus, it was the first time in 2007 that the appellant claimed his promotion with retrospective effect. However, this benefit of retrospective promotion was neither granted by the CAT nor by the High Court and thus, there is no need to delve into this aspect further. 29. The primary issue which requires adjudication is as to whether the seniority of the appellant is to be reckoned from the date of induction/ initial appointment or as per the date of promotion/confirmation in the skilled grade. 30. It is a well-settled proposition that once an incumbent is appointed to a post according to the rules, his seniority has to be reckoned from 26 Original Application No. 821 of 2007\n\n140 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the date of the initial appointment and not according to the date of confirmation, unless the rules provide otherwise. 31. In the case of L. Chandrakishore Singh v. State of Manipur and Others,27 this Court held that in cases of probationary or officiating appointments which are followed by a confirmation, unless a contrary rule is shown, the services rendered as the officiating appointment or on probation cannot be ignored while reckoning the length of service for determining the position in the seniority list. This view has been reiterated in the case of Ajit Kumar Rath v. State of Orissa and Others.28 32. The Constitution Bench of this Court in Direct Recruit Class II Engg Officers' Assn.(supra) stated the legal position with regard to inter se seniority of direct recruits and promotees and while doing so, inter alia, it was held that once an incumbent is appointed to a post according to rules, his seniority has to be counted from the date of his appointment and not according to the date of his confirmation. 33. This Court summarised the legal principles with regard to the determination of seniority in Pawan Pratap Singh and Others v. Reevan Singh and Others29 in the following terms: 45. From the above, the legal position with regard to determination of seniority in service can be summarised as follows: (i) The effective date of selection has to be understood in the context of the service rules under which the appointment is made. It may mean the date on which the process of selection starts with the issuance of advertisement or the factum of preparation of the select list, as the case may be. (ii) Inter se seniority in a particular service has to be determined as per the service rules. The date of entry in a particular service or the date of substantive appointment is the safest criterion for fixing seniority inter se between one officer or the other or between 27 [1999] Supp. 3 SCR 323 : (1999) 8 SCC 287 28 [1999] Supp. 4 SCR 302 : (1999) 9 SCC 596 29 [2011] 2 SCR 831 : (2011) 3 SCC 267 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 141 V. Vincent Velankanni v. The Union of India and Others one group of officers and the other recruited from different sources. Any departure therefrom in the statutory rules, executive instructions or otherwise must be consistent with the requirements of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. (iii) Ordinarily, notional seniority may not be granted from the backdate and if it is done, it must be based on objective considerations and on a valid classification and must be traceable to the statutory rules. (iv) The seniority cannot be reckoned from the date of occurrence of the vacancy and cannot be given retrospectively unless it is so expressly provided by the relevant service rules. It is so because seniority cannot be given on retrospective basis when an employee has not even been borne in the cadre and by doing so it may adversely affect the employees who have been appointed validly in the meantime. 34. Thus, it is trite that when an employee completes the probation period and is confirmed in service albeit with some delay, the confirmation in service shall relate back to the date of the initial appointment. Any departure from this principle in the form of statutory rules, executive instructions or otherwise must be consistent with the requirements of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India. 35. In the backdrop of the above legal and factual background, let us now examine if whether the extant rules/regulations/circulars prevailing in the establishment30 contained any stipulation that the completion of the probation period and the passing of the trade test is sin qua non for being promoted to the skilled grade and if so, whether the seniority of the employees selected on the same date would have to be reckoned from the date of confirmation/passing the trade test or from the date of initial appointment. 36. A pertinent averment is made in the counter affidavit filed by the respondents emphasizing their stand that the semi-skilled grade is only a trainee grade and in order to place an employee in the skilled grade, he would have to complete the probation period satisfactorily 30 Respondent No. 2-Factory\n\n142 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports and also clear the trade test as laid down in the SRO No. 185 of 1994. The relevant extract from SRO No. 185 of 1994 dated 1st November, 1994 is reproduced hereinbelow for the sake of ready reference. Note 6 of the said SRO reads as below: - \"Note 6. Wherever \"Trade Test\" is laid down in Column 12 of this Schedule such trade test shall be prescribed by the General manager of the factory or the Ordnance Factory Board. The term \"Trade Test\" will include written, oral and practical examination and aptitude test and interview and also statutory qualification test where applicable.\" 37. The GO dated 24th December, 2002 issued by the Ordinance Factory Board placed on record clarifies the position regarding counting of seniority in the trades of SRO No. 185 of 1994 for the industrial establishments. The language of this GO is considered germane to the controversy and hence, the relevant portion thereof is extracted hereinbelow: - \"With a view to overcome doubts in counting of seniority in respect of industrial employees who are working in trades listed at Annexure 'A' of SRO 185/1994 it has been decided to interpret rules relating to seniority in consonance with existing SRO provisions. Accordingly, the following rules for determining seniority may be followed in all OFs with immediate effect. 1) Semi-skilled posts are training post for skilled posts of trades listed at Annexure 'A' of SRO 185/1994. 2) Educational Qualification/Technical Qualification will not be deciding factor while counting seniority for trades listed at Annexure 'A' of SRO 185/1994. However, where passing of trade test/competency test or any other statutory certificate is required, the same must be adhered to and cannot be done away with. 3) Seniority will be counted from the date of promotion to Skilled grade and not from the date of induction/ entry/promotion in semi-skilled grade. 4)…… [2024] 10 S.C.R. 143 V. Vincent Velankanni v. The Union of India and Others 5)…… 6) The above orders are in consonance with the existing SRO provisions and various court orders on the subject.\" (emphasis supplied) 38. The validity of this GO31 was never assailed by the appellant at any stage either before the CAT or the High Court. A conjoint reading of SRO No. 185 of 1994 and the GO dated 24th December, 2002, which indisputably were applicable to the cadre of semi-skilled and skilled fitters in the respondent establishment32 at the relevant point of time would make it clear that the seniority in the skilled grade would have to be reckoned from the date of promotion to the skilled grade and not from the date of induction/entry in the semi-skilled grade and the candidate joining service in the semi-skilled grade would be mandatorily required to complete the probation period and also to clear the trade test for being promoted to the skilled grade. In the event of either of the two conditions not being met, the employee concerned would not be entitled to be promoted to the skilled grade. 39. The appellant, in support of his plea, has placed reliance on a GO dated 4th August, 2015, whereby the GO dated 24th December, 2002 has been superseded and it has been decided by the Competent Authority that \"henceforth\", the seniority in respect of Industrial Establishments would be governed by the relevant clause of OM dated 4th November, 1992(reproduced supra). The said GO dated 4th August, 2015 is reproduced hereinbelow for the sake of ready reference: - \"No. Per/I/Seniority/2015-16 Date: 04-08-2015 To The Sr. General Managers/ General Managers All Ordnance & Ordnance Equipment Factories Sub: Determination of Seniority in connection with direct Recruitment in the Industrial Establishment. Ref: (i) OFB Circular No. 590/OFBOL/A/I dated 24.12.2002 31 Dated 24th December, 2002 32 Engine Factory, Avadi, Chennai\n\n144 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports (ii) OFB Circular No. 590/OFBOL/A/I dated 13.01.2003 In connection with counting of Seniority in Annexure-A trades of SRO 185/1994 in the Industrial Establishment, above referred OFB Circulars clarified and directed that seniority in respect of Industrial Employees will be counted from the date of up-gradation to Skilled Grade and not from the date of induction/entry/promotion in the Semi- skilled grade. Several references in this regard have been received at OFB and after due examination, it has been observed that the OFB Circulars under reference are not in line with the principles of seniority as laid down by DOPT from time to time. Therefore, the Competent Authority has decided that in supersession of the above referred OFB Circulars dated 24.12.2002 and 13.01.2003, henceforth, seniority in respect of IEs will be governed by the relevant clause of DOPT OM No.20011/5/90-Estt(D) dated 4th November, 1992 and OM No.22011/7/86-Estt(D) dated 3rd July, 1986. Accordingly, promotion from Skilled to Highly Skilled Grade- II will be made as per the seniority fixed for Semi-skilled grade (entry grade) which will be arrived at as per merit of the select panel, without making any linkage to the date of up-gradation to the Skilled Grade. It may so happen that a person lower in the merit list of recruitment (in Semi-skilled grade) joins earlier due to early clearance of PVR. In such case, the person lower in the merit list will complete his/her qualifying service and be up-graded to Skilled Grade on earlier date as compared to a person higher in the merit list. However, person higher in the merit list will not lose his seniority and will be placed above the person lower in the merit list after getting up- gradation to Skilled Grade. (S. K. Singh) Director/IR For Director General, Ordnance Factories\" (emphasis supplied) [2024] 10 S.C.R. 145 V. Vincent Velankanni v. The Union of India and Others 40. By virtue of the above GO,33 the rule position qua the fixation of seniority has been restored to be governed by OM dated 4th November, 1992(reproduced supra), according to which the relevant date for fixation of seniority would be the date of initial appointment and not the date of upgradation/promotion to the skilled grade. The OM dated 4th August, 2015 further clarifies that the person higher in the merit list will not lose his seniority and will be placed above the person lower in the merit list after getting upgradation to the skilled grade. 41. However, the clarification issued vide GO dated 4th August, 2015 does not operate retrospectively as it is specifically provided in the said GO that \"henceforth\", the seniority in respect of Industrial Establishments will be governed by the relevant clause of OM dated 4th November, 1992. 42. It is trite law that an Office Memorandum/Government Order cannot have a retrospective effect unless and until there is an express provision to make its effect retrospective or that the operation thereof is retrospective by necessary implication. In this regard, we are benefitted by the observations of this Court in Sonia v. Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. and Others,34 wherein it was held that: \"11. ….In any view of the matter, law is well settled that an Office Memorandum cannot have a retrospective effect unless and until intention of the authorities to make it as such is revealed expressly or by necessary implication in the Office Memorandum.\" 43. If a Government Order is treated to be in the nature of a clarification of an earlier Government Order, it may be made applicable retrospectively. Conversely, if a subsequent Government Order is held to be a modification/amendment of the earlier Government Order, its application would be prospective as retrospective application thereof would result in withdrawal of vested rights which is impermissible in law and the same may also entail recoveries to be made. The principles in this regard were culled out by this Court in a recent judgment of Sree Sankaracharya University of 33 Dated 4th August, 2015 34 [2007] 8 SCR 883 : (2007) 10 SCC 627\n\n146 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Sanskrit and Others v. Dr. Manu and Another,35 in the following terms: - \"52. From the aforesaid authorities, the following principles could be culled out: i) If a statute is curative or merely clarificatory of the previous law, retrospective operation thereof may be permitted. ii) In order for a subsequent order/provision/amendment to be considered as clarificatory of the previous law, the pre-amended law ought to have been vague or ambiguous. It is only when it would be impossible to reasonably interpret a provision unless an amendment is read into it, that the amendment is considered to be a clarification or a declaration of the previous law and therefore applied retrospectively. iii) An explanation/clarification may not expand or alter the scope of the original provision. iv) Merely because a provision is described as a clarification/explanation, the Court is not bound by the said statement in the statute itself, but must proceed to analyse the nature of the amendment and then conclude whether it is in reality a clarificatory or declaratory provision or whether it is a substantive amendment which is intended to change the law and which would apply prospectively.\" 44. Applying these principles to the case at hand, we are of the view that the subsequent GO dated 4th August, 2015 cannot be read simply as a clarification and therefore cannot be made applicable retrospectively. The said GO has substantively modified the position governing seniority in the Industrial Establishments by reviving the earlier OM dated 4th November, 1992, and supersedes the orders/ circulars dated 24th December, 2002 and 13th January, 2003, which were holding the field over more than a decade. Therefore, giving retrospective effect to the GO dated 4th August, 2015 would have catastrophic effect on the seniority of the entire cadre. 35 [2023] 7 SCR 366 : 2023 SCC OnLine SC 640 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 147 V. Vincent Velankanni v. The Union of India and Others 45. This Court has time and again dealt with the effect of altering the seniority list at a belated stage and how it may adversely affect the employees whose seniority and rank has been determined in the meantime. In this connection, reference may be made to Malcom Lawrence Cecil D'Souza v. Union of India and Others,36 wherein this Court held that: - \"9. Although security of service cannot be used as a shield against administrative action for lapses of a public servant, by and large one of the essential requirements of contentment and efficiency in public services is a feeling of security. It is difficult no doubt to guarantee such security in all its varied aspects, it should at least be possible to ensure that matters like one's position in the seniority list after having been settled for once should not be liable to be reopened after lapse of many years….. Raking up old matters like seniority after a long time is likely to result in administrative complications and difficulties. It would, therefore, appear to be in the interest of smoothness and efficiency of service that such matters should be given a quietus after lapse of some time.\" 46. In R.S. Makashi and Others v. I.M. Menon and Others,37 this Court observed as follows: - \"33. …. We must administer justice in accordance with law and principles of equity, justice and good conscience. It would be unjust to deprive the respondents of the rights which have accrued to them. Each person ought to be entitled to sit back and consider that his appointment and promotion effected a long time ago would not be set aside after the lapse of a number of years. ….\" 47. In K.R. Mudgal and Others v. R.P. Singh and Others,38 this Court observed in the following terms: - \"2. … A government servant who is appointed to any post ordinarily should at least after a period of 3 or 4 years 36 (1976) 1 SCC 599 37 [1982] 2 SCR 69 : (1982) 1 SCC 379 38 [1986] 3 SCR 993 : (1986) 4 SCC 531\n\n148 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports of his appointment be allowed to attend to the duties attached to his post peacefully and without any sense of insecurity.\" 48. In B.S. Bajwa and Another v. State of Punjab and Others,39 this Court held that the seniority list should not be reopened after a lapse of reasonable period as it would disturb the settled position which is unjustifiable. The relevant extract is as follows: - \"7. … It is well settled that in service matters the question of seniority should not be reopened in such situations after the lapse of a reasonable period because that results in disturbing the settled position which is not justifiable….\" 49. It can easily be inferred that in the intervening period, before the GO dated 4th August, 2015 came to be issued, seniority of multitudes of employees must have been fixed according to the GO dated 24th December, 2002, which is according to the date of promotion to skilled grade and not from the date of induction/entry in semi-skilled grade. As a matter of fact, respondent Nos. 3, 4 and 5 who were below the appellant in the order of merit at the time of induction in the semi-skilled grade, have been promoted to the skilled grade and the highly skilled grade much before the appellant by application of the GO dated 24th December, 2002. The appellant did not question their promotions before any Court or Tribunal at any stage. 50. Thus, much water has flown under the bridge and retrospective application of the GO issued in 2015 would open floodgates of litigation and would disturb the seniority of many employees causing them grave prejudice and heartburn as it would disturb the crystallized rights regarding seniority, rank and promotion which would have accrued to them during the intervening period. To alter a seniority list after such a long period would be totally unjust to the multitudes of employees who could get caught in the labyrinth of uncertainty for no fault of theirs and may suffer loss of their seniority rights retrospectively. 51. Keeping in mind the afore-stated principles, we are of the view that applicability of the Government Order dated 4th August, 2015 cannot enure to the benefit of the appellant as its operation is clearly prospective. 39 [1997] Supp. 6 SCR 451 : (1998) 2 SCC 523 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 149 V.

Digital Supreme Court Reports the prosecution case can be accepted when evidence implicates the accused - The requirement to dispatch and serve a copy of the FIR to the jurisdictional magistrate is an external check against ante dating or ante timing of the FIR to ensure that there is no manipulation or interpolation in the FIR - Further, if the court finds the witnesses to be truthful and credible, the lack of a cogent explanation for the delay may not be regarded as detrimental. [Para 30] Evidence - Non-recovery of vehicles and weapons used in the offence - Effect on credibility of eyewitnesses, if any: Held: The ocular version of the witnesses should not be disregarded solely because the weapon used in the crime and the vehicles allegedly used by the accused were not located or seized by the police - On facts, the failure of the police to recover the vehicles and the weapons is not sufficient to undermine the credibility of the eyewitness accounts or the corroborative evidence regarding the cause of the homicidal deaths of both the deceased. [Para 27] Evidence - Witness with criminal background - Courts to exercise caution but, evidence cannot be discarded merely on the ground of criminal background: Held: Criminal background of a witness necessitates that the courts approach their evidence with caution - The testimony of a witness with a chequered past cannot be dismissed as untruthful or uncreditworthy without considering the surrounding facts and circumstances of the case, including their presence at the scene of the offence - In cases involving conflicts between rival gangs or groups, the testimony of members from either side is admissible and relevant - If the court is convinced of the veracity and truthfulness of such testimony, it may be considered - Courts assess the broader context to determine if there is sufficient corroboration, as long as there are no valid reasons to discredit the evidence - The crucial test is whether the witness is truly an eyewitness and whether their testimony is credible - If their presence at the scene is established beyond doubt, their account of the incident can be relied upon - Such evidence cannot be discarded merely on the grounds of criminal background. [Para 20] Evidence - Presence of eyewitness (PW-1) at the place of occurrence (hospital) proven, however there was [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1315 Rama Devi v. The State of Bihar and Others non- compliance with hospital and prison protocols - Reliance on testimony of PW-1, if proper - MLA and his bodyguard were murdered in the hospital where the former was admitted for treatment while in judicial custody - PW-1 did not seek prior permission from the court or jail authorities nor did he make any entry in the hospital register while visiting the deceased MLA in the hospital: Held: Fardbeyan (Exhibit-50) and the ocular evidence of PW-24 and PW25, establish the presence of PW-1 and other visitors in the hospital - Once the presence of a witness at the place of occurrence is proven, their testimony, if credible and truthful, should not be dismissed solely based on non-compliance with hospital and prison protocols - Further, the reasoning given by the High Court to disregard and doubt the eyewitness account of PW-1, on the premise that he ought to have been the informant because he is the brother-in-law of the deceased MLA and was present at the hospital at the time of occurrence, is conjectural and unfounded - Any person can be an informant of a case, and the police may also register a case on their own - The rationale of the High Court for dismissing the testimony of PW-1 is fundamentally flawed. [Para 15] Evidence - Testimony of hostile witness - Maxims - falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus - Inapplicability: Held: Maxim falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus is not a sound rule to apply in the conditions of this country - This maxim does not occupy the status of rule of law - It is merely a rule of caution which involves the question of the weight of evidence that a court may apply in the given set of circumstances - Evidence of a hostile witness is not to be completely rejected, so as to exclude versions that support the prosecution - Rather, the testimony of the hostile witness is to be subjected to close scrutiny, enabling the court to separate truth from falsehood, exaggerations and improvements - Only reliable evidence should be taken into consideration - The court is not denuded of its power to make an appropriate assessment - The entire testimony of a hostile witness is discarded only when the judge, as a matter of prudence, finds the witness wholly discredited, warranting the exclusion of the evidence in toto - The creditworthy portions of the testimony should be considered for the purpose of evidence in the case.

The second deceased - Lakshmeshwar Sahu - was the bodyguard of Brij Bihari Prasad and a member of the Bihar police. 2.

Digital Supreme Court Reports 3. The incident in question took place on 13.06.1998 at around 08:15 p.m. at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Science, Patna.5 On the basis of the fardbeyan (Exhibit 50) of Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10) recorded by S.S.P. Yadav, Inspector-cum-Officer-in-Charge, Shastri Nagar Police Station,6 on 13.06.1998 at 9:00 p.m., First Information Report7 No. 336/1998, (Exhibit 51 and 51/1) was lodged under Sections 302, 307, 34, 120B, 379 of the IPC and Section 27 of the 1959 Act at 12:15 a.m. on 14.06.1998. The Prosecution Case 4. The prosecution case is as follows: (i) On 13.06.1998 at around 6:30 p.m., Brij Bihari Prasad, who was in judicial custody and admitted for treatment at IGIMS hospital, was taking a walk outside the wardroom along with - Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10), Arbind Singh (PW-13), Ram Nandan Singh (PW-12), Mahant Ashwani Das (PW-25), Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1), Onkar Singh and 2-4 others. (ii) Brij Bihari Prasad was also accompanied by his bodyguard - Lakshmeshwar Sahu, who was armed with a carbine, and other sepoys. (iii) Two vehicles, a Sumo car, with registration number, BR-1P-1818, followed by an Ambassador car, registration number of which could not be ascertained, entered the IGIMS hospital from the southern main gate, Bailey Road side and stopped near Brij Bihari Prasad. (iv) Occupants of the said cars, namely - Mantu Tiwari (A-4), Vijay Kumar Shukla @ Munna Shukla (A-8), Rajan Tiwari (A-9), and Shri Prakash Shukla @ Shiv Prakash Shukla (since deceased), Satish Pandey (since deceased) and Bhupendra Nath Dubey (since deceased) came out of the vehicles. (v) Mantu Tiwari(A-4) was armed with a sten gun and all others were armed with pistols. Bhupendra Nath Dubey (since deceased) 5 For short, \"IGIMS Hospital\". 6 S.S.P. Yadav subsequently expired and did not depose. 7 For short, \"FIR\". [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1319 Rama Devi v. The State of Bihar and Others abusively exhorted others to shoot at Brij Bihari Prasad while he himself also fired at Brij Bihari Prasad with his pistol. (vi) Mantu Tiwari (A-4) and Shri Prakash Shukla @ Shiv Prakash Shukla (since deceased) fired at Brij Bihari Prasad from their sten gun and pistol respectively. (vii) Satish Pandey, Vijay Kumar Shukla @ Munna Shukla (A-8) and Rajan Tiwari (A-9) fired at Lakshmeshwar Sahu. (viii) Both Brij Bihari Prasad and Lakshmeshwar Sahu collapsed and died. (ix) Rabindra Bhagat (PW-14) suffered a gunshot wound in the cross-fire. 5. The post-mortem reports dated 14.06.1998 (Exhibits 9 & 9/1), proved by Dr. Arvind Kumar Singh (PW-7), establish the homicidal death of Brij Bihari Prasad and Lakshmeshwar Sahu due to multiple gunshot injuries resulting in haemorrhage and shock. The multiple gunshot wound entries are consistent with successive firing from firearms/ pistol. To this extent the prosecution version is unchallenged. 6. As per the prosecution case, there were eleven eye-witnesses, namely, Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1), Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10), Amod Kumar (PW-11), Ram Nandan Singh (PW-12), Arbind Singh (PW-13), Rabindra Bhagat (PW-14), Kamakhya Narain Singh (PW-15), Bhola Prasad Premi (PW-16), Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25), Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) and Binod Kumar Singh (PW-19). However, Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1), Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25), Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42), and to some extent, Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10) had supported the prosecution case. Others were hostile or partly hostile as they did not support the prosecution case or did not name/identify the perpetrators. 7. Primarily relying on the testimonies of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1), Mahant Ashwani Das (PW-25), Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) and Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10), the trial court convicted the respondents Suraj Bhan Singh (A-1), Mukesh Singh (A-2), Lallan Singh (A-3), Mantu Tiwari (A-4), Captain Sunil Singh (A-5) (since deceased),8 Ram Niranjan Chaudhary (A-6), Vijay Kumar 8 It is an accepted and admitted position that Captain Sunil Singh (A-5) has passed away. The appeal qua him shall stand abated. 1320 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Shukla @ Munna Shukla (A-8), Rajan Tiwari (A-9) and Shashi Kumar Rai (A-7) (since deceased).9 Reasoning of the High Court 8. The judgment of the High Court refers to the evidence in detail, with the acquittal of the respondents grounded in the following findings: (i) FIR No. 336/1998, marked Exhibit 51, is ante-timed. (ii) Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) is not an eye-witness, but rather a planted witness, as his name was not mentioned in the fardbeyan (Exhibit 50). His antecedents are questionable. (iii) The testimony of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) implicating the respondents-accused is unreliable because: (a) he is Brij Bihari Prasad's brother-in-law; (b) he should have been the informant but was not, which raises doubts about his presence at the IGIMS hospital; (c) he contradicted the prosecution's case by accepting that Rajan Tiwari (A-9), whom he knew beforehand, was not present during the incident. However, in his statement under Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973,10 he claimed that Rajan Tiwari (A-9) was one of the assailants of Lakshmeshwar Sahu; and (d) he deposed under the pressure of his sister, Rama Devi (PW-24), who was present in the court during the recording of his evidence on all (three) days. (iv) The deposition of Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) is unreliable on the following grounds: (a) he is a convict in a murder case registered in the year 1979; (b) he did not surrender after the dismissal of his appeal by the High Court and was accordingly declared an absconder; (c) he was arrested on 04.05.2006 while deposing before the trial court in the present case; 9 The appeal qua Shashi Kumari Rai (A-7) stood abated on account of his demise vide order dated 28.02.2020. 10 For short, \"CrPC\". [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1321 Rama Devi v. The State of Bihar and Others (d) he was under the patronage and protection of Brij Bihari Prasad and his wife, Rama Devi (PW-24); (e) there is a contradiction between the versions of Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) and Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) regarding their presence in the hospital room of Brij Bihari Prasad at IGIMS hospital. While Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) claims that Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) was in the hospital room when he arrived there, Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) states that Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) was already present in the hospital room of Brij Bihari Prasad when he (Mahanth Ashwani Das) reached the hospital. (f) there is a discrepancy as to when the police recorded the statement of Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) and his version of events on 13.06.1998 and 14.06.1998. Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) claims that after the occurrence he and Rama Devi (PW-24) had proceeded to the official residence of Brij Bihari Prasad from IGIMS hospital at about 9:00-9:30 p.m. Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) had left for Muzzaffarpur Math in the night at about 12:30 a.m. on 14.06.1998. Thus, the police could not have recorded the statement of Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) in the IGIMS hospital at 12:30 a.m. on 14.06.1998. Further, if Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) was present at the time of occurrence, as deposed by him, police should have recorded his statement before he left the IGIMS hospital campus around 9:30 p.m. (v) Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) was not an eye-witness, as his presence is not mentioned in the fardbeyan (Exhibit 50) or the FIR (Exhibits 51 and 51/1). His statement under Section 161 of the CrPC was recorded belatedly, five days after the incident. (vi) Rama Devi (PW-24) is not an eye-witness, as she had left the place of occurrence prior to the incident. The police did not produce Rama Devi's statement under Section 161 of the CrPC recorded on 13.06.1998 by the second investigating officer11 - 11 For short, \"IO\". 1322 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Shashi Bhushan Sharma (PW-54), who had taken charge of the investigation in compliance with the instructions of Senior Superintendent of Police, Patna. The version of Rama Devi (PW-24) that she learnt names and details of the assailants from the visitors she had met earlier in the day in the hospital room is not mentioned in the Section 161 CrPC statements dated 18.10.1999 and 28.03.2001 given by her to Rai Singh Khatri (PW-62), IO of CBI. This is corroborated by the statement of Rai Singh Khatri (PW-62), IO of CBI, who testified that Rama Devi (PW-24) did not name the assailants. Since the initial statement of Rama Devi (PW-24) under Section 161 CrPC recorded by Shashi Bhushan Sharma (PW-54) was not on record and she later failed to disclose the name of the assailants in her Section 161 CrPC statements to Rai Singh Khatri (PW-62), IO of CBI, her deposition in court, stating that Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1), Ram Niranjan Chaudhary (A-6), Kamakhya Narain Singh (PW-15), Arbind Singh (PW-13), Amarendra Kumar Sinha (Informant/PW-10), Onkar Singh, Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25), Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) and others were present with the deceased, should not be relied on. (vii) The eye-witnesses did not testify about the retaliatory firing by the security personnel of Brij Bihari Prasad who were present at the scene of the occurrence. The recovery of empty cartridges and the firearms examination report (Exhibit-17) indicate that shots were fired from two of the four rifles which had been issued to the security guards. Court depositions and analysis of evidence 9. We will now examine in some detail the court depositions of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1), Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25), Amarendra Kumar Singh (PW-10) and Rama Devi (PW-24), before scrutinising the reasons given by the High Court to discredit their versions. Our discussion will also address the arguments raised by both sides, with particular focus on the contention of the respondents that the court depositions of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1), Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25), Amarendra Kumar Singh (PW-10) and Rama Devi (PW-24) should not be accepted. 10. At the outset, we express our agreement with the reasoning given by the High Court for disbelieving the presence of Shashi Bhushan [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1323 Rama Devi v. The State of Bihar and Others Singh (PW-42) at the spot, and consequently, his deposition as an eye-witness for the following reasons: (i) Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) is not mentioned as one of the persons present at the place of occurrence in the fardbeyan (Exhibit-50), as also in the FIR (Exhibits 51 and 51/1). These documents name the eyewitnesses. Therefore, the absence of the name of Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) is significant. (ii) His statement under Section 161 CrPC was recorded on 18.06.1998, i.e., 5 days after the date of occurrence; (iii) Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) has deposed about taking the dead body of Brij Bihari Prasad on 14.06.1998 from Patna to Behihari village, the native place of Brij Bihari Prasad. Therefore, the delay in his Section 161 CrPC statement impairs his assertion of being an eyewitness, making it unworthy of acceptance; (iv) Although Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1), Mahant Ashwani Das (PW-25), and Rama Devi (PW-24) have testified to the presence of Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) as an eyewitness, this assertion should not be accepted. The fardbeyan (Exhibit P-50), being the first written account made immediately after the incident, is unexceptionable. Furthermore, the unexplained delay of five days in recording the statement of Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) as an eyewitness dents the credibility of his account. (v) For the same reasons, the reliance of the prosecution on the court testimony of Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10), averring the presence of Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) at the place of occurrence, contrary to his fardbeyan, is erratic and untrustworthy. Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10), did not entirely support the prosecution case, yet being conscious of the fact that he was the informant of the fardbeyan, he could not completely resile. His dock version about the presence of Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) has been rightly disbelieved. Testimony of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) 11. Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) is categoric about his presence in the hospital at about 6:40-7:00 p.m. on 13.06.1998 to visit Brij Bihari Prasad. He named the persons who were present with him in the 1324 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports hospital room, which includes Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25). The testimony captures the following: (i) Brij Bihari Prasad went for a walk along with the people of his constituency and supporters who had come to see him. The police personnel assigned for his protection also accompanied him. (ii) After some time, two vehicles - a white Sumo car (Registration No. BR-1P-1818) and a white Ambassador car - came into the hospital and stopped at a distance of about 20 steps in front of Brij Bihari Prasad. (iii) Bhupendra Nath Dubey (since deceased) alighted from the Sumo car, which was also carrying 2-3 more persons. 2-3 other people also alighted from the Ambassador car. (iv) Bhupendra Nath Dubey (since deceased) pointed towards Brij Bihari Prasad and ordered that he be killed, while he himself also started firing shots. Others joined him in the firing. (v) Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) specifically identified Satish Pandey (since deceased) as an occupant of the Ambassador car. (vi) Vijay Kumar Shukla @ Munna Shukla (A-8), who was a legislator from Lal Ganj, got down from the Ambassador car, while Mantu Tiwari (A-4), along with 1-2 more people, alighted from the Sumo. (vii) Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) saw Mantu Tiwari (A-4) but did not know his name. He came to know about the name subsequently from Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10) and Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42). (viii) Mantu Tiwari (A-4) was carrying a big firearm while Bhupendra Nath Dubey (since deceased) was carrying a small firearm. The other assailants were carrying either a revolver or a small firearm. (ix) Bodyguard Lakshmeshwar Sahu who was carrying a carbine, was also fired upon. (x) As a result of the firing, both Lakshmeshwar Sahu and Brij Bihari Prasad collapsed. [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1325 Rama Devi v. The State of Bihar and Others (xi) While leaving, Bhupendra Nath Dubey (since deceased) took the carbine that belonged to Lakshmeshwar Sahu and raised the slogan \"Jai Bajrang Bali\". (xii) After the assailants left, Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) and other visitors went near the dead bodies of Brij Bihari Prasad and Lakshmeshwar Sahu. (xiii) Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) identified both Mantu Tiwari (A-4) and Vijay Kumar Shukla @ Munna Shukla (A-8) in the court. (xiv) While Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) identified Rajan Tiwari (A-9) in the court, he testified that Rajan Tiwari (A-9) was not present at the place of occurrence. Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) had not seen Suraj Bhan Singh (A-1) and Shashi Kumar Rai (A-7) at the place of occurrence. (xv) Paras Nath Chaudhary (PW-1) establishes the presence of Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10), Arbind Singh (PW- 13), Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42), Ram Nandan Singh (PW-12), Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25), Rabindra Bhagat (PW-14), one Kanti, resident of Jamui, Kamakhya Narain Singh (PW-15), Ram Niranjan Chaudhary (A-6), Vijay Jha (PW-51) and 2-3 other persons at the IGIMS hospital. 12. The cross-examination of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) brings the following aspects to light: (i) He accepted that Rama Devi (PW-24) was his sister and that she was present in the court on the day of the hearing but left while his evidence was being recorded. (ii) He affirmed that Brij Bihari Prasad was admitted to the hospital 10-12 days before the occurrence. (iii) Before the date of occurrence, he met Brij Bihari Prasad in the hospital on 4-5 occasions. (iv) Brij Bihari Prasad, being in judicial custody, was admitted to IGIMS hospital by the jail administration. (v) He accepted that his sister, Rama Devi (PW-24), had contested Lok Sabha elections in the past. Rama Devi (PW-24) contested Vidhan Sabha elections after the death of Brij Bihari Prasad. 1326 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports (vi) He states that he had also taken part in the election campaign of Rama Devi (PW-24). (vii) He denied knowing the fact that Devendra Nath Dubey, one of the candidates of Motihari constituency, was the main rival of Rama Devi (PW-24). (viii) He further denied that Brij Bihari Prasad along with his brother, Shyam Bihari Prasad, murdered Devendra Nath Dubey. (ix) He affirmed his presence at the place of occurrence and denied the claim that he did not witness the incident. (x) He refuted the suggestion that being the brother-in-law of Brij Bihari Prasad, he is giving false evidence. (xi) He also denied the claim that he was deposing at the behest of his sister Rama Devi (PW-24). (xii) He reiterates that Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) and others were present at the hospital. (xiii) Two guards, which included Lakshmeshwar Sahu, were walking beside Brij Bihari Prasad. (xiv) After the firing, the hospital staff and other people present started running in different directions. (xv) Rama Devi (PW-24) came to the hospital after the incident. He testifies to seeing her cry beside the dead body of Brij Bihari Prasad. (xvi) Police officers examined the dead body of Brij Bihari Prasad and prepared an Inquest Report. He denies signing the Inquest Report or any other document. (xvii) He had gone to the hospital the next morning on 14.06.1998. (xviii) He mentioned that his police statement was recorded about 10-12 hours12 after the incident but could not recall the exact date since it was taken seven years ago. 13. Though it was pointed out that Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1), in his testimony, could not remember the number of the hospital room 12 See Trial Court Record, Vol. II, p.58.\n\n[2024] 10 S.C.R. 1327 Rama Devi v. The State of Bihar and Others or whether it was south-facing or not, this aspect would not, in our opinion, dent his core testimony. It is apposite to note that Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) was aware that the hospital room was on the ground floor and there was a verandah after crossing 4-5 rooms on the west side. He further stated that there was a cycle stand, a vacant place for sitting, and a road which joins Bailey Road on the west side. 14. Paras Nath Chaudhury13 (PW-1) accepts that he did not seek prior permission from the court or the jail authorities to visit Brij Bihari Prasad in the hospital, nor did he make any entry into the hospital register. This is also true for other visitors, a position accepted by the prosecution. The absence of a register entry or prior permission, a factor to be taken into consideration, is not sufficient reason to discard bounteous and credible evidence and material establishing that Brij Bihari Prasad, a political leader with influence, had numerous visitors and supporters meeting him at the hospital. The fardbeyan (Exhibit-50) and the ocular evidence of Rama Devi14 (PW-24) and Mahanth Ashwani Das15 (PW-25), establish the presence of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) and other visitors. Further, the following witness accounts establish the presence of visitors and eyewitnesses: ¾ Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10) has deposed and accepted the presence of Arbind Singh (PW-13), Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42), Ram Niranjan Chaudhary (A-6) and 7-8 other persons. ¾ Arbind Singh (PW-13), who was declared hostile, accepted that Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10), Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) and 5-7 other persons had come to the hospital. ¾ Rabindra Bhagat (PW-14), the injured witness who also turned hostile, deposed to the presence of two other persons accompanying Brij Bihari Prasad. Once the presence of a witness at the place of occurrence is proven, their testimony, if credible and truthful, should not be dismissed solely based on non-compliance with hospital and prison protocols. 13 See para 11(xv). 14 See para 23. 15 See para 17(ii). 1328 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 15. The reasoning given by the High Court to disregard and doubt the eyewitness account of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1), on the premise that he ought to have been the informant because he is the brother-in-law of Brij Bihari Prasad and was present at the hospital at the time of occurrence, is conjectural and unfounded. This fact cannot ipso facto lead to the disavowal of his testimony. Such a presumption imposes a rigid formula for determining who should be an informant, which the law does not envision. It is an accepted and admitted position that the name of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) has been mentioned in the fardbeyan and in the FIR as one of the persons present at the hospital. Any person can be an informant of a case, and the police may also register a case on their own. The rationale of the High Court for dismissing the testimony of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) is fundamentally flawed. 16. Yet another reason for rejecting his testimony stems from contradictions about the presence of Rajan Tiwari (A-9) as an assailant at the hospital. In his police statement, Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) identified Rajan Tiwari (A-9) as being at the hospital, but in his court testimony, he stated that Rajan Tiwari (A-9) was not present. In our considered view, this contradiction does not weaken Paras Nath Chaudhury's (PW-1) account of witnessing Mantu Tiwari (A-4) and Vijay Kumar Shukla @ Munna Shukla (A-8) commit the offence. Indian law does not recognise the doctrine - falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus. In Deep Chand and Others v. State of Haryana,16 this Court had observed that the maxim falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus is not a sound rule to apply in the conditions of this country. This maxim does not occupy the status of rule of law. It is merely a rule of caution which involves the question of the weight of evidence that a court may apply in the given set of circumstances.17 In cases where a witness is found to have given unreliable evidence, it is the duty of the court to carefully scrutinise the rest of the evidence, sifting the grain from the chaff. The reliable evidence can be relied upon especially when the substratum of the prosecution case remains intact. The court must be diligent in separating truth from falsehood. Only in exceptional circumstances, when truth and falsehood are so 16 (1969) 3 SCC 890 17 Ponnam Chandraiah v. State of Andhra Pradesh (2008) 11 SCC 640 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1329 Rama Devi v. The State of Bihar and Others inextricably connected as to make it indistinguishable, should the entire body of evidence be discarded. Testimony of Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) 17. The deposition of Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) equally supports the prosecution case. His testimony captures the following: (i) On 13.06.1998, he reached IGIMS hospital at about 7:00 p.m. to meet Brij Bihari Prasad. (ii) He confirmed the presence of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1). Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10), Arbind Singh (PW-13), Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42), Ram Niranjan Chaudhary (A-6), Ram Nandan Singh (PW-12), Onkar Singh and some other people at the hospital. (iii) After a passing remark by Ram Niranjan Chaudhary (A-6) that it was hot in the hospital room, Brij Bihari Prasad stepped outside for a stroll. Brij Bihari Prasad was accompanied by Ram Niranjan Chaudhary (A-6), Lakshmeshwar Sahu and other security personnel. (iv) In the meanwhile, a Sumo car and an Ambassador car came inside the hospital campus. About 10-12 persons alighted from the said vehicles and moved toward Brij Bihari Prasad. (v) Mantu Tiwari (A-4) was carrying a carbine and others were carrying pistols. (vi) He specifically identified Bhupendra Nath Dubey (since deceased), Shri Prakash Shukla @ Shiv Prakash Shukla (since deceased), Rajan Tiwari (A-9), Vijay Kumar Shukla @ Munna Shukla (A-8) and Satish Pandey as the persons who alighted from the aforementioned vehicles. (vii) Mantu Tiwari (A-4), Bhupendra Nath Dubey (since deceased) and Shri Prakash Shukla @ Shiv Prakash Shukla (since deceased) fired at Brij Bihari Prasad. Others were also firing indiscriminately in different directions. (viii) Vijay Kumar Shukla @ Munna Shukla (A-8), Satish Pandey and Rajan Tiwari (A-9) shot at Lakshmeshwar Sahu. (ix) On being shot, Brij Bihari Prasad and Lakshmeshwar Sahu collapsed. 1330 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports (x) Bhupendra Nath Dubey (since deceased) took the carbine belonging to Lakshmeshwar Sahu and thereafter exclaimed that the work had been done. He raised the slogan \"Jai Bajrang Bali\". (xi) His signed statement (Exhibit-29) was also recorded by a judicial magistrate. (xii) The occurrence took place at about 8:30 p.m. (xiii) The police and CBI had interrogated him in this regard. 18. We have carefully scrutinized the cross-examination of Mahanth Ashwini Das (PW-25). His cross-examination states: (i) Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) was introduced to Brij Bihari Prasad in 1996. This was around the same time Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) became a disciple under Sanatan Dharma. (ii) He had also known Rama Devi (PW-24), wife of Brij Bihari Prasad, since 1996. (iii) Rama Devi (PW-24) was present in the court while his testimony was being recorded. However, Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) denies speaking to her. (iv) Mahanth Ashwini Das (PW-25) states that while there was no particular reason to meet Brij Bihari Prasad on 13.06.1998, he would generally meet Brij Bihari Prasad whilst in Patna. (v) Earlier also he had visited Brij Bihari Prasad in the hospital on another occasion, but he could not remember the date and time of this meeting. (vi) He met Brij Bihari Prasad approximately 8-10 days prior to the date of incident. (vii) He did not know the specific treatment for which Brij Bihari Prasad was admitted to the hospital. He states that the treatment had been going on for about one and a half months. (viii) He denies having knowledge of any case(s) pending against Brij Bihari Prasad. (ix) He states that he is unaware of any case pending against him. However, he accepts that way back in 1979, a murder\n\n[2024] 10 S.C.R. 1331 Rama Devi v. The State of Bihar and Others case was registered against him, for which he had remained in jail for 3-4 months. (x) He states that he was sentenced to life imprisonment and filed an appeal in 1987; however, he was uncertain whether the appeal was still pending or had been dismissed, and he could not recall the grounds for the appeal. (xi) He did not have any documentary proof of visiting the hospital on 13.06.1998. (xii) He had not made any signatures on the death summary report and the seizure memo. (xiii) He did not know if the wife of Onkar Singh (since deceased) had given a police statement that her husband was murdered by Brij Bihari Prasad due to a contract dispute. (xiv) Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) had deposed about remaining at the place of occurrence after the firing. He saw the police coming and lifting the dead bodies of Brij Bihari Prasad and Lakshmeshwar Sahu. He left the hospital for the residence of Brij Bihari Prasad at 9:30 p.m., where several people, including Kamakhya Narain Singh (PW-15), Shiv Ji Prasad, Ram Nandan Singh (PW-12), Onkar Singh, and Raj Bala Verma (Collector, Patna), had already gathered. Later that night, on 14.06.1998, around 12:30 a.m., he departed for Muzzaffarpur Math. (xv) He was arrested on 04.05.2006 in Patna. Thereafter, he was given protection by the Bihar Government to give evidence in the present trial. Armed security guards, who were generally not present with him, used to accompany him whilst going to the court. (xvi) He states that he used to reach Smriti Bhawan of Brij Bihari Prasad at about 5:00 a.m. Rama Devi (PW-24), her driver and security guards reside at the Smriti Bhawan. (xvii) During the firing he had hidden about 30-40 steps away from the hospital room. (xviii) He denies the suggestion of giving false evidence due to his close relationship with Brij Bihari Prasad. 1332 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 19. As noted above, the High Court has rejected the testimony and complicity of the accused by Mahant Ashwani Das (PW-25) on the ground that he is himself an accused in a murder case and had absconded despite being convicted in appeal, while he was being examined as a witness in the present case. The High Court had also held that Mahant Ashwani Das (PW-25) had the patronage of Rama Devi (PW-24) and the deceased Brij Bihari Prasad. 20. The criminal background of a witness necessitates that the courts approach their evidence with caution. The testimony of a witness with a chequered past cannot be dismissed as untruthful or uncreditworthy without considering the surrounding facts and circumstances of the case, including their presence at the scene of the offence. In cases involving conflicts between rival gangs or groups, the testimony of members from either side is admissible and relevant. If the court is convinced of the veracity and truthfulness of such testimony, it may be considered. Courts typically assess the broader context to determine if there is sufficient corroboration, as long as there are no valid reasons to discredit the evidence. The crucial test is whether the witness is truly an eyewitness and whether their testimony is credible. If their presence at the scene is established beyond doubt, their account of the incident can be relied upon. Such evidence cannot be discarded merely on the grounds of criminal background.18 Testimony of Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10) 21. No doubt, Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10) turned hostile, but his core deposition captures the following: (i) He accepts having recorded the fardbeyan (Exhibit-50) on 13.06.1998 at about 9 p.m. It bears his signatures which are marked Exhibits 12 and 12/1. (ii) He had gone to the hospital at about 6:00 - 6:30 p.m. Some of the people, including Arbind Singh (PW-13), Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) and 7-8 other persons, whom he did not remember, accompanied him. (iii) He met Brij Bihari Prasad at about 6:30 p.m. in the ward. He states that the incident took place at about 8:15 p.m., and he, along with the others, stayed there till after the incident. 18 See State of U.P. v. Farid Khan and Others (2005) 9 SCC 103 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1333 Rama Devi v. The State of Bihar and Others (iv) At the time of the incident, Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10) along with Arbind Singh (PW-13), Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42), Ram Niranjan Chaudhary (A-6) and some others, had come out for a stroll with Brij Bihari Prasad. (v) Two vehicles, a Sumo and an Ambassador car, had come in. 5-6 persons alighted from the two vehicles and moved towards Brij Bihari Prasad. Thereafter, one of the assailants pointed towards Brij Bihari Prasad, identifying him as the Minister. The assailants then started firing. Brij Bihari Prasad and Lakshmeshwar Sahu were shot at, and they collapsed. Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10) and others ran towards the parking lot. One of the accused took the carbine of Lakshmeshwar Sahu. While exiting the hospital, slogans of \"Jai Bajrang Bali\" were raised by the assailants. They exited in the same vehicles from the east gate. (vi) He does not remember the registration number of the vehicles. He, along with the other visitors present there, had informed the hospital staff, who in turn, informed the police. (vii) He identified Bhupendra Nath Dubey (since deceased) and Mantu Tiwari (A-4). He could not identify the other accused. He claimed that Bhupendra Nath Dubey (since deceased) and Mantu Tiwari (A-4) were carrying pistols. (viii) Mantu Tiwari (A-4) was not present in the court when Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10) was being examined. However, he identified Ram Niranjan Chaudhary (A-6) who was present in the court. (ix) As he did not recognize the other accused, he was declared hostile and was allowed to be cross-examined by the prosecution. (x) In his cross-examination, he denied that Mantu Tiwari (A-4) fired from his sten gun. (xi) He also denied the presence of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1), claiming that he had not seen him in the hospital. (xii) However, he accepts in the cross-examination that he had put his signatures on the fardbeyan. (xiii) He was not cross-examined at length by the defence. 1334 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 22. We have already referred to judgments of this Court while examining the doctrine of falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus. The same principles equally apply when the court examines the statement of a witness who has been declared hostile by the prosecution. In a catena of judgments, this Court has observed that the evidence of a hostile witness is not to be completely rejected, so as to exclude versions that support the prosecution. Rather, the testimony of the hostile witness is to be subjected to close scrutiny, thus enabling the court to separate truth from falsehood, exaggerations and improvements. Only reliable evidence should be taken into consideration. The court is not denuded of its power to make an appropriate assessment. The entire testimony of a hostile witness is discarded only when the judge, as a matter of prudence, finds the witness wholly discredited, warranting the exclusion of the evidence in toto.19 The creditworthy portions of the testimony should be considered for the purpose of evidence in the case. It is in this context that we have to examine the testimony of Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10), the complainant/ informant, who gave the fardbeyan (Exhibit P-50) on which basis the FIR (Exhibit P-50/51) was registered. Testimony of Rama Devi (PW-24) 23. Rama Devi (PW-24) confirmed the presence of the witnesses - Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1), Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25), and Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10) at the IGIMS hospital. On 13.06.1998, Rama Devi (PW-24) had taken food to the hospital at about 2:50 p.m. and stayed there till about 7:00 p.m. From the hospital, she went to Maurya Lok to purchase some items for her sons and remained there for about one and a half hours. Whilst leaving Maurya Lok, she learnt about the attack on her husband, Brij Bihari Prasad. She immediately reached IGIMS hospital where she saw Brij Bihari Prasad and Lakshmeshwar Sahu lying dead in a pool of blood. Several people had gathered there. She established the presence of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1), Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25), and Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10) at the hospital. 19 See C. Muniappan and Others v. State of Tamil Nadu (2010) 9 SCC 567 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1335 Rama Devi v. The State of Bihar and Others 24. We will exclude the testimony of Rama Devi (PW-24) regarding the individuals who arrived in the two vehicles and the detailed version about the occurrence which she heard from the people present there, including Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1), Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25), and Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10), which is hearsay. However, her testimony establishing the presence of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1), Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25), and Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10) is direct evidence and cannot be discarded. Rama Devi (PW-24) was at the hospital for a considerable time before and after the incident. Her version is factually accurate and fosters confidence. Thus, the testimony of Rama Devi (PW-24) can be used to partly corroborate and affirm the testimonies of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1), Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25), and Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10). 25. The testimony of Rama Devi (PW-24) is also relevant from the point of view of motive, a question which is not contentious, as is clear from the questions posed to her in her cross-examination. She has affirmed having contested the Lok Sabha elections against Devendra Nath Dubey, who was murdered. Brij Bihari Prasad, her husband, was implicated in the said case as an accused. Her husband was also arrested in MEDHA scam by the CBI. He was subsequently lodged in Beur Jail. Due to his ill health, he was taken to Patna Medical College from where he was referred to IGIMS hospital. 26. Mantu Tiwari (A-4) is the nephew of the late Bhupendra Nath Dubey (since deceased), who was the brother of Devendra Nath Dubey, a political rival of Rama Devi (PW-24). Devendra Nath Dubey was killed a day before the re-poll for the Motihari Lok Sabha Constituency. Brij Bihari Prasad was named as an accused in the case. The longstanding animosity is further highlighted by the fact that Vijay Kumar Shukla @ Munna Shukla (A-8) is the brother of Chottan Shukla and Bhutkun Shukla, who were allegedly killed by the henchmen of Brij Bihari Prasad. Further, Rama Devi (PW-24) testified that in 1987, there was an assassination attempt on her husband, Brij Bihari Prasad, statedly orchestrated at the behest of Raghunath Pandey (chargesheeted in the present case but since deceased), with Vijay Kumar Shukla @ Munna Shukla (A-8), Chottan Shukla and Bhutkun Shukla involved in the attack. 1336 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Identification and non-recovery of vehicles and weapons 27. Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) and Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) have identified the vehicles used by the accused on 13.06.1998. They have specifically deposed about a Sumo bearing registration no. BR-1P-1818. The Sumo and the Ambassador cars, which they have referred to in their depositions, were not recovered. The weapons used in the offence, including the carbine belonging to the deceased Lakshmeshwar Sahu, also could not be recovered. However, given the facts and circumstances of the case, the failure of the police to recover the vehicles and the weapons is not sufficient to undermine the credibility of the eyewitness accounts or the corroborative evidence regarding the cause of the homicidal deaths of Brij Bihari Prasad and Lakshmeshwar Sahu. The ocular version of the witnesses should not be disregarded solely because the weapon used in the crime and the vehicles allegedly used by the accused were not located or seized by the police.20 28. It is significant to note that the vehicle No. BR-1P-1818 (Sumo), as per the deposition of the second IO, Shashi Bhushan Sharma (PW-54), had been taken under a hire-purchase agreement by the late Devendra Nath Dubey, brother of Bhupendra Nath Dubey (since deceased), from a finance company - SBR Private Limited, Calcutta. The said assertion had remained unchallenged in the cross-examination of Shashi Bhushan Sharma (PW-54). The vehicle No. BR-1P-1818 is also mentioned in the fardbeyan (Exhibit P-50) of Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10). Forwarding of the FIR 29. The impugned judgment has observed that the FIR (Exhibits 51 and 51/1) is ante-timed. The High Court, in its reasoning, highlights this as one of the grounds for acquitting the accused. In the present case, the first IO, SSP Yadav, passed away before he could depose. However, registration of the FIR itself is not in doubt and debate and has been deposed to by Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10). We have evidence with regard to the statement of eye-witnesses which were recorded under Section 161 CrPC on the night of occurrence, as is clear from the depositions of Paras Nath Chaudhury 20 See Yogesh Singh v. Mahabeer Singh and Others (2017) 11 SCC 195 which refers to several other decisions. See also State of Rajasthan v. Arjun Singh and Others (2011) 9 SCC 115 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1337 Rama Devi v. The State of Bihar and Others (PW-1), Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25), and Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10). The inquest reports of Brij Bihari Prasad and Lakshmeshwar Sahu (Exhibits 42/1 and 52) were prepared on the same night and, thereafter, the post-mortem was conducted by Dr. Arvind Kumar Singh (PW-7) at 12:30 a.m. and 1:30 a.m. respectively on 14.06.1998. 30. The occurrence having taken place at night on 13.06.1998, normally the FIR should have been sent to the jurisdictional magistrate on 14.06.1998. However, 14.06.1998 being a Sunday was a holiday. The FIR was forwarded to the jurisdictional magistrate on 15.06.1998. There is, therefore, an explanation for the delay in forwarding a copy of the FIR to the jurisdictional magistrate in terms of Section 157 of the CrPC. It is trite law that a delay in forwarding the FIR to the jurisdictional magistrate is not fatal to the prosecution case. This Court, in State of Rajasthan v. Daud Khan,21 has examined the case law on the subject and held that when there is a delay in forwarding the FIR to the jurisdictional magistrate and the accused raises a specific contention regarding the same, they must demonstrate how this delay has prejudiced their case. Mere delay by itself is not sufficient to discard and disbelieve the case of the prosecution. If the investigation starts in right earnest and there is sufficient material on record to show that the accused were named and pinpointed, the prosecution case can be accepted when evidence implicates the accused. The requirement to dispatch and serve a copy of the FIR to the jurisdictional magistrate is an external check against ante dating or ante timing of the FIR to ensure that there is no manipulation or interpolation in the FIR. If the court finds the witnesses to be truthful and credible, the lack of a cogent explanation for the delay may not be regarded as detrimental. Police Statements of Eye-witnesses 31. The High Court, in its reasoning, takes an exception on the minor discrepancies regarding the place and time of recording the statement under Section 161 CrPC of Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25). Similarly, the impugned judgment has adversely commented on the versions given by Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) and Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) as to who had reached the hospital at an earlier point in time. 21 (2016) 2 SCC 607 1338 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Considering the efflux of time of more than 4-6 years between the date of occurrence and recording of court testimony, these issues are at best superficial and peripheral and would not warrant disregarding the prosecution case. The questions posed to the witnesses were more in the nature of a memory test rather than questions posed to test the truthfulness and credibility of their core testimony. Equally, the observation of the High Court on the statement under Section 161 CrPC of Rama Devi (PW-24) to Rai Singh Khatri (PW-62), IO of the CBI, is inconsequential. Section 161 CrPC statement of Rama Devi, in which she had given the names and details of the persons who were present in the hospital, cannot be brushed aside solely on this ground. Statements under Section 161 CrPC are per se not evidence in the court. Rama Devi's statement under Section 161 CrPC was recorded on 13.06.1998 and the same was filed along with the chargesheet. She was not cross-examined regarding the said statement. 32. The assertion that Rama Devi's (PW-24) Section 161 CrPC statement dated 13.06.1998 to Shashi Bhushan Sharma, IO (PW-54), has not been included in the record is solely predicated on her cross-examination conducted on 21.02.2006. Rama Devi's (PW-24) acknowledgement during her cross-examination reflects a clear lapse in memory, likely due to the nearly eight-year gap and the length of her questioning. It is a well-established fact that SSP Yadav was the IO on 13.06.1998, making it impossible for Shashi Bhushan Sharma (PW-54) to have recorded her Section 161 CrPC statement on that date. Moreover, Shashi Bhushan Sharma (PW-54) was never questioned about whether he had recorded Rama Devi's (PW-24) Section 161 CrPC statement on 13.06.1998. In fact, both the defence and prosecution agree that Shashi Bhushan Sharma (PW-54) took over the investigation on 14.07.1998. Attesting Witnesses and Retaliatory Firing 33. The contention that Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) and Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) were not attesting witnesses to the inquest report, fardbeyan, FIR, etc. is inconsequential and does not in any way weaken their ocular evidence. Similarly, the contention that they were not injured during the cross-fire is nugatory as it is clear from the evidence on record that it was Brij Bihari Prasad who was the target of the attack. The armed bodyguards who were attacked [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1339 Rama Devi v. The State of Bihar and Others had retaliated. Although it is true that the depositions of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) and Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) do not mention the retaliatory firing by the bodyguards, an independently proven fact, this alone is not a sufficient ground to dismiss their presence at the spot or their versions including the culpability of the persons who had committed the offence. Offence under Section 307 read with Section 34 of the IPC 34. Rabindra Bhagat (PW-14) had averred to his presence at IGIMS hospital on 13.06.1998 in the evening at about 7-7:30 p.m. when he was shot at and received a bullet injury in his left arm during the attack on Brij Bihari Prasad. He called his brother, Sanjeev Kumar, who took him to Alok Nursing Home for treatment. Rabindra Bhagat (PW-14), however, did not identify the culprits. Dr. Tarkeshwar Prasad Singh (PW-8) examined injured Rabindra Bhagat (PW-14) on 13.06.1998 at 9:30 P.M. and issued the injury report dated 08.08.1998 (Exhibit-10). The deposition of Dr. Tarkeshwar Prasad Singh (PW-8) refers to the entry and exit wounds on the left arm of Rabindra Bhagat (PW-14) inflicted by a gunshot approximately two hours before the medical examination. In any case, it is proven that in spite of the number of people present, there was extensive firing and the use of firearms with intent to kill. The charge under Section 307 of the IPC is, therefore, established and proved. The Charge of Criminal Conspiracy 35. The case was transferred to CBI by Notification dated 07.03.1999, pursuant to which it conducted an investigation. The CBI filed two supplementary chargesheets implicating Suraj Bhan Singh (A-1), Ram Niranjan Chaudhary (A-6), Shashi Kumar Rai (A-7) and Raghunath Pandey, who had since died, as conspirators who were responsible for the incident. A supplementary chargesheet was filed against Shashi Kumar Rai (A-7) on 08.11.2000, followed by a second supplementary chargesheet dated 20.04.2001 against Raghunath Pandey. 36. The prosecution case makes a charge of conspiracy based on an alleged meeting which took place in Beur Jail where Suraj Bhan Singh (A-1) was incarcerated. Suraj Bhan Singh (A-1) is said to have reportedly met with Vijay Kumar Shukla @ Munna Shukla (A-8), Lallan Singh (A-3) and Ram Niranjan Chaudhary (A-6). However, the witnesses to this meeting, Sone Lal (PW-32) and Lal 1340 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Babu Chaudhury (PW-39), turned hostile and did not support the prosecution version. This evidence is based on the testimony of Shashi Bhushan Sharma (PW-54) that Sone Lal (PW-32) and Lal Babu Chaudhury (PW-39) informed him about the said jail meeting on 19.08.1998, nearly two months after the date of occurrence. Shashi Bhushan Sharma (PW-52) failed to establish how he discovered the purported version of Sone Lal (PW-32) and Lal Babu Chaudhury (PW-39). He was also unable to establish that Sanjay Singh, the inmate whom Sone Lal (PW-32) and Lal Babu Chaudhury (PW-39) had allegedly visited, was present in Beur Jail 2-3 days before the incident. There is no record of Sone Lal (PW-32) and Lal Babu Chaudhury (PW-39) visiting Beur Jail. 37. Further, the claim of the prosecution regarding the dubious character of Ram Niranjan Chaudhary (A-6) and that he encouraged Brij Bihari Prasad to go outside his hospital room for a walk is not directly implicatory. Rather, it is an assumption requiring substantial evidence to be established. It only expresses doubt about Ram Niranjan Chaudhary (A-6), an insider who could have given information. 38. To prove the charge of conspiracy, the prosecution further relied upon the telephone records of Mokama landline number 32772, which was supposedly subscribed to by Suraj Bhan Singh (A-1). The telephone records indicate calls made from Mokama landline number 32772 to Shashi Kumar Rai (A-7), Sunil Singh (A-5) (since deceased) and Munna Shuka (A-8). The prosecution relied on the report dated 29.10.1999 (Exhibit-1) submitted by Shiya Sharan Ram (PW-2), Sub-Divisional Engineer (Vigilance), Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited, which stated that the landline number was subscribed in the name of one Shrawan Kumar Agrawal but was operational in the house of Suraj Bhan Singh (A-1) at Mokama. However, the said report of Shiya Sharan Ram (PW-2) is based on the physical verification of S.M.M. Rahman, Sub-Divisional Engineer, Barh and Jitan Mehta, Junior Telecom Officer, Hatida, both of whom, have not been examined. Further, Shrawan Kumar Agrawal has also not been examined. The original report prepared by S.M.M. Rahman and Jitan Mehta is also not on record. The prosecution version establishing the landline number as belonging to Suraj Bhan Singh (A-1) hinges on the testimony of M.L. Meena (PW-60), Assistant IO, CBI. However, M.L. Meena (PW-60) accepts in his testimony that [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1341 Rama Devi v. The State of Bihar and Others he did not enter the house to verify the existence of a telephone set. Rather, his entire version is based on his interaction with the step-mother of Suraj Bhan Singh (A-1). The telephone records indicating the exchange of calls between 11.05.1998 and 11.06.1998, as deposed by Rai Singh Khatri (PW-62), do not substantively prove and establish the conspiracy charge in the absence of revelatory and weighty incriminating material. 39. The CBI also relied upon the post-incident celebration held in village Khanjah Ghat on 15.06.1998 at the behest of Vijay Kumar Shukla @ Munna Shukla (A-8). Amod Kumar (PW-11), Sushil Kumar Singh (PW-35) and Pooja (PW-37), who were statedly witnesses to the post-incident celebration turned hostile. The statement of Avadhesh Kumar Singh (PW-36), who did not turn hostile, was recorded one year and two months after the date of occurrence. The prosecution has not placed any material on record to showcase how M.L. Meena, IO, CBI (PW-60) had traced Avadhesh Kumar Singh (PW-36), though Rai Singh Khatri, IO, CBI (PW-62) had stated that M.L. Meena, IO, CBI (PW-60) had got in touch with Avadhesh Kumar Singh (PW-36). The evidence of Avadhesh Kumar Singh (PW-36) and Pooja (PW-37) establishing the presence of Shashi Kumar Rai (A-7), since deceased, in the post-incident celebration is not entirely credible. In any case, Shashi Kumar Rai (A-7) passed away during the pendency of the present appeals. 40. To fortify the charge of conspiracy, the prosecution has further relied on the fax message (Exhibit-6) regarding the threat to the life of Brij Bihari Prasad. This fax message would not help the prosecution implicate the accused persons - Suraj Bhan Singh (A-1), Mukesh Singh (A-2), Lallan Singh (A-3) and Captain Sunil Singh (A-5) (since deceased) - on the charge of criminal conspiracy. Discrepancy regarding the presence of Rajan Tiwari (A-9) 41. As noticed above, Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) in his deposition had categorically stated that Rajan Tiwari (A-9) was not present with the other accused who had murdered Brij Bihari Prasad and Lakshmeshwar Sahu. Even though Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) had referred to the presence of Rajan Tiwari (A-9), given the discrepancy in the statement of the two eye-witnesses, we feel that the benefit of doubt must be given to Rajan Tiwari (A-9). 1342 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Conclusion 42. Even if we completely exclude the testimony of Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42), the depositions of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1), Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) and, to some extent of Rama Devi (PW-24) and Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10) with other evidence and material are conclusive enough to prove the charge against Mantu Tiwari (A-4) and Vijay Kumar Shukla @ Munna Shukla (A-8). Bhupendra Nath Dubey and Captain Sunil Singh (A-5) are no more, and, therefore, we need not consider the evidence against them. Similarly, we need not examine the depositions implicating Shashi Kumar Rai (A-7), who died during the pendency of the present appeals. 43. Regarding the question of conspiracy and the evidence against Suraj Bhan Singh (A-1), Mukesh Singh (A-2), Lallan Singh (A-3) and Ram Niranjan Chaudhary (A-6), there is no direct ocular evidence implicating them through the testimonies of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) and Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25). Since the charge of conspiracy is not substantiated, we will not interfere with the judgment of the High Court acquitting them, and they are entitled to the benefit of the doubt. 44. In light of the above discussion, we hold and direct as under: a) The charge under Section 302 read with Section 34 of the IPC against Mantu Tiwari (A-4) and Vijay Kumar Shukla @ Munna Shukla (A-8) for the murders of Brij Bihari Prasad and Lakshmeshwar Sahu is proven and established beyond reasonable doubt. b) The charge under Section 307 read with Section 34 of the IPC against Mantu Tiwari (A-4) and Vijay Kumar Shukla @ Munna Shukla (A-8) for attempting to murder, as held in paragraph 34 above, is proven and established beyond reasonable doubt. c) The conviction and sentence awarded to Mantu Tiwari (A-4) and Vijay Kumar Shukla @ Munna Shukla (A-8) by the trial court under Sections 302 and 307 read with Section 34 of the IPC are affirmed and restored. d) Consequently, Mantu Tiwari (A-4) and Vijay Kumar Shukla @ Munna Shukla (A-8) shall have to undergo imprisonment for\n\n[2024] 10 S.C.R. 1343 Rama Devi v. The State of Bihar and Others life with a fine of Rs. 20,000/- (Rupees Twenty Thousand Only) each under Section 302 read with Section 34 of the IPC, and in addition to undergo rigorous imprisonment for five years with a fine of Rs. 20,000/- (Rupees Twenty Thousand Only) each under Section 307 read with Section 34 of the IPC. Both the sentences shall run concurrently. Section 428 of the CrPC shall apply. As default punishment was not imposed by the trial court, we direct that in case of non-payment of fine on each account, Mantu Tiwari (A-4) and Vijay Kumar Shukla @ Munna Shukla (A-8) shall undergo rigorous imprisonment for six months. e) Mantu Tiwari (A-4) and Vijay Kumar Shukla @ Munna Shukla (A-8) are directed to surrender within two weeks from today to the concerned jail authorities/court to serve the remainder of their respective sentences. In case of failure to surrender, the authorities shall take appropriate measures to arrest and detain them in accordance with law. f) Insofar as Suraj Bhan Singh (A-1), Mukesh Singh (A-2), Lallan Singh (A-3), Ram Niranjan Chaudhary (A-6) and Rajan Tiwari (A-9) are concerned, we give them benefit of doubt and uphold their acquittal. 45. The appeals are partially allowed and the impugned judgment is set aside in terms and vide the directions issued in paragraph 44 above. Pending applications, if any, shall also stand disposed of. Result of the case: Appeals partly allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Divya Pandey", "2024_10_1344_1358_EN": "[2024] 10 S.C.R. 1344 : 2024 INSC 763 Shashi Bhushan Prasad Singh v.

Judgment / Order of the Supreme Court Judgment Satish Chandra Sharma, J. 1. Leave Granted. 2. The present batch of appeals arise out of judgement dated 16.02.2023, passed by the High Court of Judicature at Patna in Civil Writ Jurisdiction Case No. 3411/2022 ('CWJC') along with\n\n[2024] 10 S.C.R. 1347 Shashi Bhushan Prasad Singh v. The State of Bihar and Others other connected matters (the 'Impugned Order'), whereby the Writ Petitioners who were the unsuccessful candidates in the Recruitment Process conducted pursuant to the Advertisement dated 08.03.2019 for the post of Junior Engineer (Civil), had challenged the vires of Rule 9(1)(ii) of the Bihar Water Resources Department Subordinate Engineering (Civil) Cadre Recruitment (Amendment) Rules 2017, published vide notification dated 07.11.2017, prescribing technical qualification eligibility for selection/appointment to the technical post in the State of Bihar. The appellants before this Court are the successful candidates in the said Recruitment Process. 3. The present matter begins with the issuance of Advertisement No. 01/2019 dated 08.03.2019 by the Bihar Technical Service Commission ('BTSC') inviting applications for 6,379 vacancies to the post of Junior Engineer across various state departments (the 'Advertisement'). The Advertisement specified that the educational qualification required for the post of Junior Engineer (Civil) as under: \"Educational Eligibility. a) Junior Engineer (Civil) i. Diploma-in-Civil Engineering conferred by the concerned Technical Educational Council/University recognised by All India Council of Technical Education, New Delhi. ii. Diploma-in-Civil Engineering through non-distance mode conferred by the concerned Deemed University established under the UGC Act provided the Deemed University is duly approved by the University Grants Commission for the said Course.\" It is pertinent to note that this requirement is drawn from and is identical to Rule 9(1)(iii) of the Bihar Water Resources Department Subordinate Engineering (Civil) Cadre Recruitment Rules, 2015 (the 'Rules') as amended in 2017. 4. The private Respondents in the present appeal were the Writ Petitioners before the High Court. They were all applicants who possessed a Diploma from Private Universities/Institutions established by statute and approved by the University Grants Commission. Their applications were found ineligible by the BTSC on the ground that their institutions were not approved by the All-India Council of 1348 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Technical Education ('AICTE'). Aggrieved, they approached the High Court seeking the quashing of Rule 9(1)(iii) of the Rules as being inconsistent with other statutory provisions and judgement of the Apex Court in Bharathidasan University & Anr. vs. AICTE & Ors. 2001 (8) SCC 676 wherein, on an interpretation of the provisions of the All-India Council of Technical Education Act 1987, it was held that Universities are excluded from the purview of technical institutions and are thus not required to obtain approvals from the AICTE before introducing technical courses/programs. 5. The Writ Petitioners relied on public notice dated 09.02.2022 issued by the AICTE, to the VCs of all Central/State and Private Universities about AICTE approval for 2022-23, stating as follows: \"Dear Sir/Madam, lt is intimated that Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in case of Bharathidasan University & Another Vs AICTE & Others has interpreted the provisions of the AICTE Act and has held that university do not require prior approval of AICTE to commence a new department of course and programmes in technical education. Universities have obligation or duty to conform to the standards and norms laid down by the AICTE. For the purpose of ensuring coordinated and integrated development of technical education and maintenance of standards, AICTE may cause an inspection of the university, which has to be as per the provisions under relevant rules/regulations of the AICTE. Further, all affiliated institutions running technical education programmes requires prior approval of AICTE. However, it has been observed that some of the Central / State / Private Universities are taking partial approval of AICTE for some selected Technical Courses / Programmes, which is creating confusion among the stakeholders. Therefore, AICTE decided that no partial approval of technical courses will be given to Universities in order to avoid confusion among stakeholders. Accordingly, all universities are hereby informed that either they take full approval of all technical courses, or they can continue without approval of AICTE.\"\n\n[2024] 10 S.C.R. 1349 Shashi Bhushan Prasad Singh v. The State of Bihar and Others 6. It is relevant to note that the stand of the Writ Petitioners was reinforced by the AICTE before the High Court, as made explicit by their Counter Affidavit dated 12.05.2022, which read as under: \"8. That so far the statements made in paragraph no. 15 of the writ petition concern it is submitted that AICTE vide its public notification for approval process 2021-22 had categorically clarified that the central/state public private universities are not required to take approval of the AICTE for technical programs except ODL and online courses. This position has also been confirmed in the public notice issued for approval process 2022-23…………..\" 7. At this stage, it is apposite to observe that prior to the filing of CWJC No. 3411/2022, the High Court was already hearing several analogous writs challenging different provisions of the Rules as applicable to the selection process under the Advertisement. Accordingly, vide order dated 02.05.2019 passed in CWJC No. 9887/2019, the BTSC was permitted to continue the selection process, with the results to be kept in a sealed cover, pending the outcome of the proceedings. This order was later modified vide order dated 06.12.2019 in CWJC No. 21651/2018 whereby the High Court allowed the selection process to be completed but directed that all orders of appointments must state that appointments are subject to the outcome of the writ petitions and therefore, the selected candidates cannot claim any equity. 8. Accordingly, on 02.04.2022, the BTSC published its selection list for the posts advertised under the Advertisement ('Select List') and the selected candidates were also allotted to specific departments. In compliance with the aforenoted interim orders, the Select List reproduced the directions given by the Court in order dated 06.12.2019 and explicitly stated that the Select List shall be affected in light of the final order in the pending proceedings. 9. Thereafter, in a separate analogous writ proceeding being CWJC No. 7312/2021, vide order dated 19.04.2022, Rule 4(A) of the Rules which granted 40% institutional reservation to diploma holders from State-run Polytechnic Institutes was found to be arbitrary and unreasonable. Consequently, Select list prepared in terms of Rule 4(A) was set aside and the BTSC was directed to prepare a fresh select list granting 40% institutional reservation to diploma 1350 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports holders from any polytechnic institute, recognized by the AICTE and affiliated with the State Board of Technical Institutions, Bihar and located within the State. 10. Following this, the BTSC proceeded to finalise the merit list under the Advertisement but were directed by the High Court vide order 01.12.2022 in CWJC No. 7761/2022 to withhold the declaration of results until leave is granted by the Court. A list was prepared on 19.12.2022, put under sealed cover and permission of the Court was sought by filing an interlocutory application in CWJC No. 7761/2022 (the 'Final Select List'). The hearing of the application was adjourned after the Advocate General informed the Court that the State Government was contemplating a review of the entire process. 11. On 25.01.2023, the Govt. of Bihar convened a high-level meeting of Secretaries from different works departments to consider the legal issues emerging from the numerous pending litigations against the Rules and the Advertisement and the consequent 4-year delay in appointments. A decision was taken inter alia to cancel the appointment process under the Advertisement and to initiate approval for the amended Rules. 12. Once the decision dated 25.01.2023 was brought on record before the High Court, the State Govt. was permitted to implement its decisions dated 25.01.2023 and the Court concluded that nothing remained in the matter. Accordingly, CWJC No. 3411/2022 and all other analogous writs were disposed of in the following manner: \"In the instant writ petitions, petitioners have prayed for the following relief/reliefs: i. For quashing of Rule 9(1)(ii) of Rules \"Bihar Water Resources Department Subordinate Engineering (Civil) Cadre Recruitment (Amendment) Rules, 2017 contained in Notification no. 3950 dated 07.11.2017 prescribing technical qualification eligibility for selection/appointment to the technical post in the State of Bihar, as being inconsistent with other statutory provisions, in contravention of the Hon'ble Supreme Court's judgment and is violative of fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution of India.\n\n[2024] 10 S.C.R. 1351 Shashi Bhushan Prasad Singh v. The State of Bihar and Others ii. For declaration of the aforesaid rules as being ultra vires to the Constitution of India so far amendment of Rule -9(1)(iii) is concerned. iii. For any other relief/reliefs to which the petitioner is found entitled to. 2. Matter is relating to selection and appointment to the post of Junior Engineer. In this regard, advertisement was issued on 08.03.2019. From time to time, matter was taken up for hearing and during the course of the hearing we have noticed certain errors in the relevant Rules governing the post of Junior Engineer. Ultimately, State Government has taken a decision to cancel the process of recruitment to the post of Junior Engineer with reference to advertisement issued on 08.03.2019 and proposed to issue a fresh or amendment of Rules while rectifying certain errors which have crept in the existing Rules. To that effect, supplementary counter affidavit has been filed on behalf of respondent No. 4 while enclosing decision dated 25.01.2023 vide Annexure - A to the supplementary counter affidavit. Perusal of the same, it is evident that certain errors which have crept in the Rules would be carried in amendment of relevant Rules etc. The proposed action of the State respondents reads as under: '4. After due deliberations on all aspects, it was resolved that: a. In view of the legal wrangle crept in presently, the Recruitment process emanating from the Advertisement No.01/2019 notified by the Bihar Technical Service Commission be cancelled. b. The Department which earlier send its requisition for appointment to the Commission shall withdraw their respective requisition from the Bihar Technical Service Commission and such Department would send their such requisition afresh only after framing of new Recruitment Rules. 1352 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports c. Action be also initiated for cancellation of the Junior Engineer Recruitments Rules which are presently in vogue in various departments and thereafter, the amended Junior Engineer Recruitments Rules be framed. d. Steps be taken as to the approval of the Council of Ministers be accorded to the amended junior Engineer Recruitment Rules for the appointment of the Junior Engineer.' 3. In the light of these new developments, the present petitions do not survive for consideration. Accordingly, State is permitted to carry out necessary amendment and proceed afresh to advertise for the post of Junior Engineer. 4. From the date of last advertisement till date, almost four years have elapsed, therefore, such of those candidates who are likely to be over-aged with reference to ensuing advertisement, for such of those candidates (who are applicants to the advertisement dated 08.03.2019), State Government must make a provision in the proposed amendment insofar as giving age relaxation as a one time measure. The above exercise shall be completed within a period of four months from the date of receipt of this order. 5. Pending I.A., if any, stands disposed of. 6. At this stage, learned counsel for one of the contesting respondent submitted that liberty may be reserved to challenge the proposed amendment. Such liberty is not necessary for the reasons that as and when Rules or amended rules were issued afresh, it would be a fresh cause of action to the respective parties.\" 13. Learned Senior Counsels for the Appellants, Mr. Rajeev Dhavan, Mr. Ranjit Kumar and Ms. Meenakshi Arora urged before this Court that at the outset, the Writ Petitioners, having knowingly participated in the selection process under the Advertisement were bound by the doctrine of acquiescence and therefore, could not have challenged the eligibility criteria post-facto. Reliance is placed on Punjab National\n\n[2024] 10 S.C.R. 1353 Shashi Bhushan Prasad Singh v. The State of Bihar and Others Bank vs. Anit Kumar Das (2021) 12 SCC 80 and The Chairman SBI & Anr. vs. M.J. James (2022) 2 SCC 301. 14. The learned counsels for the Appellants also contended that the cancellation of the entire selection process after its completion and preparation of the Final Select List, is unjustified and amounts to changing the rules of the game after the declaration of results, which is impermissible. Reliance is placed on K. Manjusree vs. State of Andhra Pradesh & Anr. (2008) 3 SCC 512. It is argued that the Appellants, who emerged successful after the due process of selection which was carried out as per the Advertisement, have a vested right to be appointed and are instead being made to suffer though no fault of their own. 15. They further contended that the decision taken by the State Government and approved by the High Court amounts to arbitrary action as it fails to specify the concern/anomaly with Rule 9(1)(iii) which necessitated the cancellation of the entire process. 16. Learned Counsel for the Private Respondents i.e., the Writ Petitioners before the High Court also contended that the cancellation of the entire selection process, at such a tardy stage would seriously impact their interests. They argue that as per the stand of the AICTE before the High Court, their applications were eligible and should thus be reconsidered along with the applications of the Appellants. 17. Learned Senior Counsel for the State, Mr. Patwalia vehemently contends that the State was well within its domain to scrap the selection process considering the numerous legal issues that cropped up concerning the previously applicable Rules. It is brought to the notice of this Court that in furtherance of its decisions, as approved by the Impugned Order, the Govt. of Bihar has repealed the existing Rules and notified the Bihar Subordinate Engineering (Civil/Mechanical/Electrical) Cadre Rules, 2023 (the 'New Rules') vide Notification No. 1174 dated 07.03.2023. In compliance with the directions of the High Court, appropriate provisions for the grant of one-time age relaxations have also been made under Rule 8(2) of the New Rules. Further, the BTSC has cancelled the Advertisement vide notice dated 10.04.2023 and fresh requisitions have been sent by the Water Resources Department to the BTSC vide letter dated 21.03.2023 for selection against 2252 vacant posts for Junior Engineers in that department. 1354 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 18. Mr. Patwalia further contends that the completion of the selection process under the Advertisement, resulting in the Select List and in the Final Select List was consistently carried out with the rider that the appointments would be subject to the outcome of the pending litigation. He argues that while the Select List was partially set aside by the High Court vide order dated 19.04.2022, the Final Select List was neither considered by the High Court nor published, and therefore, no right to appointment vests with the Appellants, making any claim to equity untenable. 19. At this stage, it is pertinent to note that while issuing notice, this Court vide order dated 24.04.2023 directed the maintenance of status quo which has persisted till date. As per the most recent status report by the State, nearly 9,187 posts of Junior Engineers remain vacant, drastically affecting the day-to-day functioning of the State. As retirements are ongoing, the working strength is continuously decreasing and is currently at 11.7%. In recognition of the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case, Mr. Patwalia has fairly stated before this Court that the State will abide by any appropriate direction given by the Court. 20. We have heard Learned Counsel for the parties and perused the record. 21. As evidenced above, the present case has a chequered history. Before the Advertisement was released, an amendment was brought to the Rules in 2017, more particularly to Rule 9, which restricted the eligibility criteria only to those candidates who possessed a Diploma from an institute approved by the AICTE. This amendment was prima facie contrary to the decision of this Court in Bharathidasan University (supra) which is solidified by the stand of the AICTE before this Court and their public notice dated 19.02.2022. However, despite this infraction, the Advertisement contained the same restriction, arbitrarily disqualifying persons like the Writ Petitioners from the selection process. 22. Thereafter, the first Select List that was prepared was partly set aside vide order dated 19.04.2022 in CWJC No. 7312/2021 and the BTSC was directed to prepare a fresh Select List as under: \"Accordingly, appointments made to extent in terms of Rule 4(A) of amending Rules, 2017 are set aside and the\n\n[2024] 10 S.C.R. 1355 Shashi Bhushan Prasad Singh v. The State of Bihar and Others Bihar State Technical Selection Commission is directed to prepare afresh select/merit list granting 40% institutional reservation to all the diploma holders, who have obtained their diploma certificate from any polytechnic institutes recognized by AICTU and affiliated by State Board of Technical Institutions, Bihar, Patna within the State of Bihar.\" 23. Consequently, the Select List prepared on 02.04.2022 was impliedly set aside and a Final Select List was prepared by the BTSC in compliance with order dated 19.04.2022 but the same was not released as ordered by the Patna High Court vide order dated 01.12.2022 in another analogous writ proceeding being CWJC No. 7761/2022 as under: \"…Process of selection and appointment, in terms of advertisement dated 8.9.2019, is nearing completion. Under these circumstances, as prayed for, we grant two weeks' time to file reply. In the meanwhile, process of selection may carry on, but the result shall not be declared without leave of the Court.\" 24. It is pertinent to note that the order dated 19.04.2022 passed in CWJC No. 7312 of 2021 does not appear to have been challenged further and has attained finality. It is stated by the BTSC that the Final Select List was prepared and kept under sealed cover. While an application seeking release of the list was pending before the High Court, the Writ Petition was withdrawn. 25. During the present proceedings, vide order dated 10.09.2024, this Court sought information regarding the Final Select List from the State Government and the same was produced before this Court in sealed cover. 26. Presently, despite the preparation of the Final Select List which signals the conclusion of the appointment process, the State Government seeks to scrap the entire process and undertake a fresh appointment process under the New Rules. In the considered opinion of this Court, this amounts to effectively changing the rules of the game after the game was played which is impermissible and 1356 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports deprives the candidates of their legitimate right of consideration under the previous Rules. 27. The High Court in the impugned order has abruptly and without assigning reasons and without adjudicating any issues involved in the writ petitions, disposed of the same, recording the statement made by the learned counsel for the State, and permitted the State to amend Rules in question. Since, the entire recruitment process was concluded as per the extant Rules till the selection list was declared on 02.04.2022, which has not been specifically set aside by the High Court, and since the AICTE has also continued its stand that its approval is not necessary for the private institutions, and since the order dated 19.04.2022 passed in CWJC No. 7312/2021 has attained finality, in our opinion, the interest of justice would be met if the State/Commission is directed to prepare a fresh select list of meritorious candidates in respect of the Advertisement dated 08.03.2019, keeping in view the above facts and keeping in view that no appointments to the post of Junior Engineer (Civil) have been made since last more than ten years. Hence, it is required to be directed that a fresh selection list for the vacancies advertised in the Advertisement dated 08.03.2019 be prepared of the meritorious candidates, considering the above observations and in compliance with the order dated 19.04.2022 passed by the High Court in CWJC No. 7312/2021 as expedient as possible and preferably within three months of this order. 28. In this regard, the field is held by the three-judge bench decision of this Court in K. Manjusree (supra) wherein the Court, relying on previous decisions, explicitly held that introducing new requirements into the selection process after the entire selection process was completed amounted to changing the rules of the game after the game was played. Relevant portions of the judgement are reproduced as under: \"27. But what could not have been done was the second change, by introduction of the criterion of minimum marks for the interview. The minimum marks for interview had never been adopted by the Andhra Pradesh High Court earlier for selection of District & Sessions Judges, (Grade II). In regard to the present selection, the Administrative Committee merely adopted the previous procedure in vogue. The previous procedure as stated above was to [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1357 Shashi Bhushan Prasad Singh v. The State of Bihar and Others apply minimum marks only for written examination and not for the oral examination. We have referred to the proper interpretation of the earlier Resolutions dated 24-7-2001 and 21-2-2002 and held that what was adopted on 30-11-2004 was only minimum marks for written examination and not for the interviews. Therefore, introduction of the requirement of minimum marks for interview, after the entire selection process (consisting of written examination and interview) was completed, would amount to changing the rules of the game after the game was played which is clearly impermissible. We are fortified in this view by several decisions of this Court. It is sufficient to refer to three of them -- P.K. Ramachandra Iyer v. Union of India [(1984) 2 SCC 141 : 1984 SCC (L&S) 214], Umesh Chandra Shukla v. Union of India [(1985) 3 SCC 721 : 1985 SCC (L&S) 919] and Durgacharan Misra v. State of Orissa [(1987) 4 SCC 646 : 1988 SCC (L&S) 36 : (1987) 5 ATC 148] 32. In Maharashtra SRTC v. Rajendra Bhimrao Mandve [(2001) 10 SCC 51 : 2002 SCC (L&S) 720] this Court observed that \"the rules of the game, meaning thereby, that the criteria for selection cannot be altered by the authorities concerned in the middle or after the process of selection has commenced\". In this case the position is much more serious. Here, not only the rules of the game were changed, but they were changed after the game had been played and the results of the game were being awaited. That is unacceptable and impermissible.\" 29. Therefore, in light of the aforenoted position, the State action of scrapping the entire selection process is not permissible. In view of the peculiar circumstances of this case, particularly the prolonged pendency leading to huge number of vacant posts that hinder the Government's functioning, this Court finds it appropriate for the State/ BTSC to proceed with the Fresh Select List submitted in compliance with the order dated 19.04.2022 in CWJC No. 7312/2021 which has attained finality, as also taking into consideration as far as possible, the interest of the candidates who were found successful. Hence, the Fresh Select List must be appropriately revised in the following manner:\n\n1358 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports (i) The Fresh Select List be prepared in view of order dated 19.04.2022 passed by the High Court in CWJC No. 7312/2021. (ii) The Fresh Select List shall also include as far as possible those meritorious candidates who were otherwise eligible but were declared ineligible solely on account of the 2017 amendment to the Rules i.e., on account of their institute not being recognised by the AICTE, and all similarly placed successful candidates. (iii) The BTSC is directed to prepare the Revised Select List within 3 months of this Order and the State Government is directed to act upon the Revised Select List submitted by the Commission within a period of 30 days thereafter. 30. Accordingly, the present appeals are disposed of with the aforenoted directions.

Case Arising From CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION : Civil Appeal Nos. 8315-8316 of 2014 From the Judgment and Order dated 11.11.2011 of the High Court of Kerala at Ernakulam in EFA Nos. 6 and 7 of 1998 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1361 Renjith K.G. & Others v.

Bharathan, Mrs. Anu K Joy, Alim Anvar, Ajith Anto Perumbully, Advs. for the Respondent. Judgment / Order of the Supreme Court Judgment R. Mahadevan, J. Heard Mr. Rajeev Mishra and Mr. Sanand Ramakrishnan, learned counsel for the appellants and Mr. Jayant Muth Raj, learned senior counsel and Mrs. Nishe Rajen Shonker, learned counsel for the Respondent. 2. These Civil Appeals are preferred against the judgment and order dated 11.11.2011 passed by the High Court of Kerala at Ernakulam1 in E.F.A Nos.6 and 7 of 1998, whereby, the High Court allowed the said appeals and remanded the matter to the trial Court for fresh consideration. 3. Succinctly stated facts are that the appellants are the legal representatives of the original plaintiff / decree holder viz., Padmakshy (deceased), who had filed a suit in O.S.No.38 of 1956 before the Sub Court, Parur, for partition and separate possession of her share in the plaint schedule 13 items of immovable properties. The Sub Court, Parur, passed a preliminary decree on 23.10.1958. Subsequently, the said suit was transferred to the file of the Additional District Court, Parur and re-numbered as O.S.No.82 of 1960, in which, a final decree was passed on 09.03.1970. 4. The dispute revolved around is qua item no.4 of the plaint schedule property measuring an extent of 1 acre 57 cents in Sy.No.120/10 situated at Muppathepadam Kara, Kodungallur Village, Paravur Taluk, Kerala, which originally belonged to one Ayyapan, who had eight children. In the year 1085 M.E.2 the said Ayyappan executed a 1 Hereinafter shortly referred to as \"the High Court\" 2 Malayalam Era or the Malayalam Calendar. To get the corresponding year on the Gregorian Calendar, add 826 which makes it 1911. 1362 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports mortgage in favour of one Kunjan and created a further mortgage in favour of the same mortgagee in the year 1093 M.E.3 On the death of Ayyappan, his six children assigned their 6/8 shares in favour of one Raghuthaman, by gift deed No. 2147 dated 17.07.1963 and the remaining 2/8 shares were obtained by the Defendant No.1, by name, Padmanabhan, as per the deed No.1491 of 1119 M.E.4 On the death of the mortgagee Kunjan, his rights devolved on the Defendant No.1 and the original plaintiff Padmakshy (who was a minor at that time). The Defendant No.1, without the concurrence of Padmakshy, executed a mortgage for Rs.1,000/- in favour of one Nanu, in the year 1123 M.E.5 and the said Nanu, in turn, assigned his right to the Defendant No.10, by name, Veeran, as per deed No.101 of 1951. As per document No.3669 of 1964, the Defendant No.10 assigned his right to the said Raghuthaman. 5. In the final decree proceedings, qua item no.4, based on the Advocate Commissioner's report, the plaintiff was allotted one half portion of the property in Sy.No.120/10 i.e., red shaded portion in Ex.C2 plan; and the Defendant No.10 was directed to pay a sum of Rs.461.67 towards equalisation and also mesne profit at the rate of Rs.64.80 per year to the plaintiff. The final decree was engrossed on the requisite stamp paper on 19.11.1990. To execute the same, the plaintiff preferred an Execution Petition bearing No.4 of 1991, in which, notice was ordered to the defendants / judgment debtors, but, they did not turn up. Ultimately, the Executing Court ordered delivery of possession and accordingly, a portion of item no.4 plaint schedule property, as shown in Ex.C2 plan, was delivered to the plaintiff on 22.11.1994. 6. Thereafter, the aforesaid Raghuthaman preferred E.A.No.1 of 1995 in E.P. No.4 of 1991under Order XXI Rule 99 of the Civil Procedure Code6 for re-delivery of the property mentioned in Ex.C2 plan, claiming independent right, title and interest in the same. Along with this application, he also filed E.A.No.2 of 1995 seeking an order of injunction restraining the plaintiff from committing waste till the disposal of EA No.1 of 1995; and E.A.No.3 of 1995 for recovery 3 Gregorian Calendar year 1919 4 Gregorian Calendar year 1945 5 Gregorian Calendar year 1949 6 For short, \"CPC\" [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1363 Renjith K.G. & Others v. Sheeba of damages to the tune of Rs.25,000/- from the plaintiff for having committed waste in the property. All the three applications were jointly heard and were dismissed, by a common order dated 12.08.1997. 7. Aggrieved by the aforesaid order passed in E.A. Nos.1 and 3 of 1995, the said Raghuthaman filed Execution First Appeals viz., EFA Nos.6 of 1998 and 7 of 1998, which came to be dismissed by the High Court, by judgment dated 30.05.2007. Seeking to review the said judgment, the respondents herein, who are the legal representatives of the said Raghuthaman, filed R.P.Nos.1107 and 934 of 2007, which came to be allowed, by order dated 22.03.2010. Pursuant to the same, E.F.A Nos.6 and 7 of 1998 were re-heard and were eventually, allowed by the High Court, by the judgment dated 11.11.2011 which is impugned herein. 8. The first and foremost contention of the learned counsel appearing for the appellants is that the predecessor of the respondents (Raghuthaman) did not establish his independent right, title or interest in the property in question and he was only a pendente lite transferee and therefore, he cannot resist the execution of a decree filed by the original plaintiff / decree holder. Additionally, the learned counsel submitted that the decision in Chiranji Lal (D) by LRs. v. Hari Das (D) by LRs.7 relied on by the High Court is not applicable to the facts of the present case. 9. The learned counsel appearing for the contesting respondent, on the other hand, submitted that the final decree was passed on 09.03.1970; it was engrossed on the stamp paper on 19.11.1990; the execution petition seeking delivery of possession of the property under the decree was preferred only on 13.03.1991, which was clearly barred by limitation as per Article 136 of the Limitation Act. That apart, the predecessor of the respondents under Order XXI Rule 99 CPC is entitled to raise the question of limitation for the execution of the decree, which has become time-barred. Accordingly, the High Court set aside the order dated 12.08.1997 passed in EA Nos.1 and 3 of 1995 and remanded the matter to the trial Court for fresh consideration, by the judgment impugned herein, which does not call for any interference at the hands of this Court. 7 [2005] Supp. 1 SCR 359 : (2005) 10 SCC 746 1364 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 10. We have considered the rival submissions made by the learned counsel on either side and perused the records carefully and meticulously. 11. The facts narrated above are not disputed. Concededly, in the suit filed by the original plaintiff, preliminary decree was passed on 23.10.1958; final decree was passed on 09.03.1970 and it was engrossed on stamp paper on 19.11.1990; and the Execution Petition seeking delivery of possession of the suit properties, came to be filed only on 13.03.1991. It is also to be noted that in the final decree, there was no order directing the parties to furnish stamp papers for the purpose of engrossing the decree. 12. Seemingly, the predecessor of the respondents claimed right, title and interest qua 78.5 cents forming part of item no.4 of the plaint schedule property, by virtue of the assignment deed dated 01.12.1964 bearing No.3669 executed by the Defendant No.10. Pursuant to the order of the Executing Court, he was dispossessed from the subject property, in which, he was occupying and the possession was handed over to the plaintiff / decree holder. After repeated challenge, the applications preferred by the predecessor of the respondents seeking re-delivery of possession and damages, contending inter alia that the Execution Petition was barred by limitation, came to be allowed and the matter was remanded to the trial Court for fresh consideration, by the judgment impugned herein. 13. It was the specific plea of the appellants that the predecessor of the respondents being a pendente lite transferee, is not entitled to file an application under Order XXI Rule 99 CPC and raise the question of limitation of the Execution Petition, so as to deprive the right of the appellants to enjoy the fruits of the decree. 14. On a reading of Order XXI Rule 99 CPC, it is lucid that where any person other than the judgment debtor is dispossessed of immovable property by the holder of a decree for the possession of such property, or where such property has been sold in execution of a decree, by the purchaser thereof, he may make an application to the Court complaining of such dispossession. It also means that a third party to the decree has a right to approach the Court even after dispossession of the immovable property, which he was occupying. In the case on hand, the predecessor of the respondents was not a party to the suit and he was dispossessed from the property, in [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1365 Renjith K.G. & Others v. Sheeba execution of the decree passed in the suit and therefore, he who is purported to be a stranger to the decree, can very well adjudicate his claim of independent right, title and interest in the decretal property as per Order XXI Rule 99 CPC. 15. In so far as the claim of appellants that the predecessor of the respondents, namely Mr. Raghuthaman, being pendent lite transferee and hence would have no locus to file the application seeking re- delivery, we have already held that \"any person\" not a party to the suit or in other words a stranger to the suit can seek re-delivery, after he has been dispossessed. The term \"Stranger\" would cover within its ambit, a pendent lite transferee, who has not been impleaded. That apart, the facts in the present case disclose that the property stood transferred to the predecessor of the respondents before the Final Decree was passed in 1970. The fact that Mr.Raghuthaman had successfully resisted the claim of the 9th Defendant for delivery of possession, in the presence of the predecessor of the appellant is not disputed. While so, it was incumbent on the appellants to have impleaded the predecessor of the respondents by filing an application under Order 21 Rule 97 of CPC, when they resisted the delivery. The pendent lite purchaser has every right to defend his right, title, interest and possession. This Court recently while adjudicating the right of a pendent lite transferee held as under: Yogesh Goyanka v. Govind (2024) 7 SCC 524 : 2024 SCC OnLine SC 1692 \"16. The fulcrum of the dispute herein concerns the impleadment of a transferee pendente lite who undisputedly had notice of the pending litigation. At the outset, it appears pertinent to reiterate the settled position that the doctrine of lis pendens as provided under Section 52 of the Act does not render all transfers pendente lite to be void ab initio, it merely renders rights arising from such transfers as subservient to the rights of the parties to the pending litigation and subject to any direction that the Court may pass thereunder. \"17. Therefore, the mere fact that RSD was executed during the pendency of the underlying suit does not automatically render it null and void. On this ground alone, we find the impugned order to be wholly erroneous as 1366 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports it employs Section 52 of the Act to nullify RSD and on that basis, concludes that the impleadment application is untenable. Contrary to this approach of the High Court, the law on impleadment of subsequent transferees, as established by this Court has evolved in a manner that liberally enables subsequent transferees to protect their interests in recognition of the possibility that the transferor pendente lite may not defend the title or may collude with the plaintiff therein (see the decision of this Court in Amit Kumar Shaw v. Farida Khatoon [Amit Kumar Shaw v. Farida Khatoon (2005) 11 SCC 403] & A. Nawab John v. V.N. Subramaniyam [A. Nawab John v. V.N. Subramaniyam (2012) 7 SCC 738 : (2012) 4 SCC (Civ) 324] ).\" 16. The difference between the rights of a decree holder qua a third party to the suit and the right of a third party after being dispossessed has been laid down by this Court in Sriram Housing Finance & Investment (India) Ltd. v. Omesh Mishra Memorial Charitable Trust (2022) 15 SCC 176 : 2022 SCC OnLine SC 794, wherein it was held as follows: \"24. On conjoint reading of the aforesaid provisions, it can be observed that under Rule 97, it is only the \"decree-holder\" who is entitled to make an application in case where he is offered resistance or obstruction by \"any person\". In the present case, as admitted by the appellant itself, it is a bona fide purchaser of the property and not the \"decree-holder\". As available from the material placed on record, it is the respondent Trust along with legal heirs of late N.D. Mishra who are the decree-holders and not the appellant. Therefore, it is obvious that the appellant cannot take shelter of Rule 97 as stated above to raise objections against execution of decree passed in favour of the respondent. Further, Rule 99 pertains to making a complaint to the Court against \"dispossession\" of the immovable property by the person in \"possession\" of the property by the holder of a decree or purchaser thereof. \"25. It is factually not in dispute that the appellant purchased the said property from Mr Yogesh Mishra vide\n\n[2024] 10 S.C.R. 1367 Renjith K.G. & Others v. Sheeba sale deed dated 12-4-2004 and has been in vacant and physical possession of the property since then. Had it been the case that the appellant was dispossessed by the respondent Trust in execution of decree dated 2-9- 2003, the appellant would have been well within the ambit of Rule 99 to make an application seeking appropriate relief to be put back in possession. On the contrary, the appellant in the instant case was never dispossessed from the property in question and till date, as contended and unrefuted, the possession of same rests with the appellant. Considering the aforesaid, the appellant cannot be said to be entitled to make an application under Rule 99 raising objections in execution proceedings since he has never been dispossessed as required under Rule 99. 26. Now, as stated above, applications under Rule 97 and Rule 99 are subject to Rule 101 which provides for determination of questions relating to disputes as to right, title or interest in the property arising between the parties to the proceedings or their representatives on an application made under Rule 97 or Rule 99. Effectively, the said Rule does away with the requirement of filing of fresh suit for adjudication of disputes as mentioned above. Now, in the present case, Order 21 Rule 101 has no applicability as the appellant is neither entitled to make an application under Rule 97 nor Rule 99 for the reasons stated above. Accordingly, we find no substance in the argument raised by the learned counsel for the appellant.\" Therefore, once an application under Order 21 Rule 99 is filed, it is incumbent upon the Trial Court to consider all the rival claims including the right title and interest of the parties under Order 21 Rule 101 which bars a separate suit by mandating the execution court to decide the dispute. 17. As regards the question of limitation for execution of a decree passed in the suit for partition, this Court, in the decision in Chiranji Lal (supra), has categorically held that the time begins to run from the date of final decree and not from the date on which it is engrossed on the stamp paper. For better appreciation, the relevant passage of the said decision is reproduced below: 1368 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports \"24. A decree in a suit for partition declares the rights of the parties in the immovable properties and divides the shares by metes and bounds. Since a decree in a suit for partition creates rights and liabilities of the parties with respect to the immovable properties, it is considered as an instrument liable for the payment of stamp duty under the Indian Stamp Act. The object of the Stamp Act being securing the revenue for the State, the scheme of the Stamp Act provides that a decree of partition not duly stamped can be impounded and once the requisite stamp duty along with penalty, if any, is paid the decree can be acted upon. 25. The engrossment of the final decree in a suit for partition would relate back to the date of the decree. The beginning of the period of limitation for executing such a decree cannot be made to depend upon date of the engrossment of such a decree on the stamp paper. The date of furnishing of stamp paper is an uncertain act, within the domain, purview and control of a party. No date or period is fixed for furnishing stamp papers. No rule has been shown to us requiring the court to call upon or give any time for furnishing of stamp paper. A party by his own act of not furnishing stamp paper cannot stop the running of period of limitation. None can take advantage of his own wrong. The proposition that period of limitation would remain suspended till stamp paper is furnished and decree engrossed thereupon and only thereafter the period of twelve years will begin to run would lead to absurdity. In Yeswant Deorao Deshmukh v. Walchand Ramchand Kothari [1950 SCR 852] it was said that the payment of court fee on the amount found due was entirely in the power of the decree holder and there was nothing to prevent him from paying it then and there; it was a decree capable of execution from the very date it was passed. 26. Rules of limitation are meant to see that parties do not resort to dilatory tactics, but seek their remedy promptly. As above noted, there is no statutory provision prescribing a time limit for furnishing of the stamp paper for engrossing the decree or time limit for engrossment of the decree on\n\n[2024] 10 S.C.R. 1369 Renjith K.G. & Others v. Sheeba stamp paper and there is no statutory obligation on the Court passing the decree to direct the parties to furnish the stamp paper for engrossing the decree. In the present case the Court has not passed an order directing the parties to furnish the stamp papers for the purpose of engrossing the decree. Merely because there is no direction by the Court to furnish the stamp papers for engrossing of the decree or there is no time limit fixed by law, does not mean that the party can furnish stamp papers at its sweet will and claim that the period of limitation provided under Article 136 of the Act would start only thereafter as and when the decree is engrossed thereupon. The starting of period of limitation for execution of a partition decree cannot be made contingent upon the engrossment of the decree on the stamp paper. The engrossment of the decree on stamp paper would relate back to the date of the decree, namely, 7th August, 1981, in the present case. In this view the execution application filed on 21st March, 1994 was time barred having been filed beyond the period of twelve years prescribed under Article 136 of the Act. The High Court committed illegality in coming to the conclusion that it was not barred by limitation.\" 18. The above judgment was relied upon by the Constitutional Bench of this Court while deciding the validity of an unstamped agreement, wherein it was observed as under: Interplay Between Arbitration Agreements under A&C Act, 1996 & Stamp Act, 1899, In re (2024) 6 SCC 1 : 2023 SCC OnLine SC 1666 \"255. In Chiranji Lal v. Hari Das [Chiranji Lal v. Hari Das (2005) 10 SCC 746] , a three-Judge Bench of this Court rejected the contention that an unstamped preliminary decree is not enforceable and, therefore, the period of limitation begins to run when the decree is engrossed on the stamp paper. The Stamp Act is a fiscal measure with the object to secure revenue for the State on certain classes of instruments. The Stamp Act is not enacted to arm the litigant with a weapon of technicality to meet the case of his opponent. As there is no rule which prescribes 1370 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports any time for furnishing of stamp paper or to call upon a person to pay stamp duty on a preliminary decree of partition, the proposition that period of limitation would remain suspended till stamp paper is furnished and decree engrossed thereon was rejected.\" 19. Applying the ratio laid down in Chiranjilal case (Supra) to the facts of the present case, the High Court rightly set aside the order passed in the Execution Petition and remanded the matter to the trial court for fresh consideration, leaving all the issues including the independent right, title or interest claimed by the respondents in the property in question, to be adjudicated therein. Therefore, we do not find any infirmity or illegality in the judgment so rendered by the High Court, warranting our interference. 20. In view thereof, these Civil Appeals stand dismissed. However, it is open to the appellants to raise all the contentions available to them before the trial Court. Costs made easy. 21. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of. Result of the case: Appeals dismissed. †Headnotes prepared by: Divya Pandey", "2024_10_1371_1380_EN": "[2024] 10 S.C.R. 1371 : 2024 INSC 780 IDBI Bank Ltd. v. Ramswaroop Daliya and Ors.

Case Arising From CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal Nos. 11115-11116 of 2024 From the Judgment and Order dated 19.09.2022 and 29.11.2022 of the High Court for the State of Telangana at Hyderabad in WP No. 3820 of 2020 and RP No. 1 of 2022 respectively Appearances for Parties Krishan Kumar, Nitin, Seemant K. Garg, Advs. for the Appellant. R Anand Padmanabhan, Sr. Adv., Shashi Bhushan Kumar, Arimardhan Sharma, Ms. Ruchi Arya, Ms. Laxmi, R. Sharath, Advs. for the Respondents. Judgment / Order of the Supreme Court Judgment Pankaj Mithal, J. 1. Leave granted. 2. The appellant-IDBI Bank has preferred these two appeals challenging the judgment and order dated 19.09.2022 passed by the High Court in Writ Petition No. 3820 of 2020, \"Ramswaroop Daliya and 3 Ors. vs. IDBI Bank Ltd.\" and the order dated 29.11.2022 passed in Review Petition No. 1 of 2022 arising from the above writ petition. 3. The respondents who were the petitioners in the writ petition are the auction purchasers of the property which comprises of 2 guntas of land of Survey No. 121 part, situated at Bogaram village, Keesara Mandal, Medchal Malkajgiri district, Telangana. Pursuant to the e-auction notice dated 17.03.2018, the auction took place on 1374 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 10.04.2018. The respondents were the highest bidders for a total sum of Rs. 1,42,50,000/-. They deposited 25% of the bid amount i.e., Rs. 36,00,000/- on the day of the auction itself. The auction was confirmed but the sale certificate was not issued and the sale deed was not executed as the respondents could not deposit the balance sale consideration within 15 days, may be for the reason that the appellant-Bank refused to accept the balance amount for various reasons. Finally, the appellant-Bank vide communication dated 24.12.2019 cancelled the auction and refunded the amount deposited by the respondents by means of four demand drafts which were never encashed by the respondents. 4. The respondents as such invoked the writ jurisdiction of the High Court challenging the action of the appellant-Bank cancelling the auction dated 10.04.2018 unilaterally and for seeking a direction to issue the sale certificate after receiving the balance sale consideration of Rs. 1,06,50,000/-. 5. The aforesaid Writ Petition No. 3820 of 2020 filed by the respondents was allowed by the impugned judgment and order dated 19.09.2022 passed by the High Court holding that the appellant-Bank was not justified in withholding the sale certificate. The respondents were always ready and willing to pay the sale consideration. The appellant-Bank could not have denied the issuance of the sale certificate and the execution of the sale deed. The issuance of the sale certificate was not refused by the appellant-Bank for want of non-deposit of the balance sale consideration within 90 days as stipulated under Rule 9(4) of the Security Interest (Enforcement) Rules, 2002,1 therefore, such a plea taken by the appellant-Bank for the first time in the writ petition is not tenable. 6. The argument of the learned counsel for the appellant-Bank is that in view of the statutory provisions contained under the Rules, especially Rule 9(4) of the Rules, since the respondents had not deposited the balance sale consideration within the mandatory period of 90 days, the High Court has erred in directing the appellant-Bank to issue the sale certificate and to execute the sale deed. The balance sale consideration was never deposited by the respondents within the time permitted and the letter(s) of the respondents clearly establishes that 1 Hereinafter referred to as 'the Rules' [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1375 IDBI Bank Ltd. v. Ramswaroop Daliya and Ors. they kept on seeking extension of time without depositing the amount. Moreover, on the complaint of the appellant-Bank to the Central Bureau of Investigation2 made on 08.03.2018, the Enforcement Directorate3 had taken suo moto cognizance and issued an advisory to the appellant-Bank not to release the title deeds. 7. In the facts and circumstances of the case, the only issue which arises for consideration is as to whether there was any default on part of the respondents in depositing the balance amount within the time prescribed pursuant to the auction sale dated 10.04.2018 so as to attract Rule 9(4) of the Rules and allow the appellant-Bank to cancel the auction which had already been confirmed. 8. There is no dispute to the fact that the appellant-Bank had issued e-auction notice on 17.03.2018 and had conducted the auction on 10.04.2018. The respondents had participated in the said auction and were recognized as the highest bidder who deposited 25% of the auction money amounting to Rs. 36,00,000/- then and there. On the very same day, a sale confirmation letter was issued by the authorized officer of the appellant-Bank requiring the respondents to pay the balance amount of Rs. 1,06,50,000/- within 15 days so that the sale certificate may be issued. 9. It may be noted that the respondents at no point of time have denied payment of the balance auction money as demanded to be paid within the 15 days period. It was only the appellant-Bank that denied the issuance of the sale certificate, first on the pretext that the guarantor had filed Writ Petition No. 12390 of 2018 challenging the e-auction notice dated 17.03.2018 and had obtained a stay order on 18.04.2018. Secondly, the appellant-Bank on 08.03.2018 had made a complaint to the CBI and that ED took suo moto cognizance whereby an advisory was issued to the appellant-Bank not to release the original property documents and that the same be kept in safe custody of the bank till further directions of the ED. 10. The appellant-Bank issued e-auction Notice on 17.03.2018 after it had already made the complaint to the CBI but this aspect of the matter was not disclosed in the advertisement. Thus, a conscious decision 2 In short \"CBI\" 3 In short \"ED\" 1376 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports was taken by the appellant-Bank to go ahead with the e-auction despite there being a complaint to the CBI. It is subsequent to the complaint to the CBI that the e-auction notice was issued and the e-auction was conducted on 10.04.2018 which was also confirmed in favour of the respondents. In such a situation it does not lie in the mouth of the appellant-Bank to take shelter on the basis of the complaint made to the CBI and to deny issuance of the sale certificate, particularly when there was no specific direction either of the CBI or the ED not to confirm the auction sale or to issue the sale certificate. The only rider was to keep the property documents in safe custody. The respondents, on the other hand, never insisted for the release or the handing over of the property documents rather submitted that they would not create any third-party interest in the property auctioned and that the original documents of the property would be collected by them, subsequently on the consent and clearance from the CBI and ED. In the light of such a stand taken by the respondents on affidavit, the appellant-Bank apparently was not justified in refusing to issue sale certificate to the respondents on the pretext that there was an advisory from the ED. It is worth noticing that even the advisory of ED dated 08.06.2018 is not material for not accepting the balance sale consideration within the period of 15 days stipulated in the sale confirmation letter dated 10.04.2018 which period expired on 25.04.2018, much before the issuance of the above advisory. The respondents were not responsible either for the delay in depositing or non-acceptance of the balance auction amount by the appellant-Bank. 11. As far as the filing of Writ Petition No. 12390 of 2018 by one of the guarantors is concerned, an interim stay order was passed therein on 18.04.2018 by which time the auction had already taken place and confirmed. The said writ petition was ultimately dismissed on 18.07.2018 and as such the interim stay order ceased to exist. The interim stay order granted therein was of no effect insofar as the issuance of sale certificate to the respondents was concerned as the sale had already taken place and stood confirmed before the passing of the interim stay therein. There was no direction or stay on the issuance of sale certificate. The passing of the interim stay order in the above writ petition was not on account of the respondents so as to assign any default on their part in depositing the balance sale consideration within the time stipulated. [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1377 IDBI Bank Ltd. v. Ramswaroop Daliya and Ors. 12. The communication dated 24.12.2019, by which the appellant-Bank took a decision to cancel the auction sale and to return the amount deposited by the respondents, is completely silent as regards the default, if any, committed by the respondents in depositing the balance auction amount as per the mandate of Rule 9(4) of the Rules. The said plea was taken by the appellant-Bank for the first time through the counter affidavit filed in the writ petition. It is well recognized that the validity of an order can only be adjudged on the basis of the reasoning contained in the order and the said reasoning cannot be supplemented in any manner much less by means of a counter affidavit or a supplementary affidavit when the parties have entered into a litigation. In Mohinder Singh Gill & Anr. v. Chief Election Commissioner and Ors.4 it has been clearly laid down that the parties are not permitted to raise new pleas not contained in the order impugned while assailing the correctness or the validity of such an order. In view of the law so laid down, the appellant-Bank was certainly not entitled to raise the plea of default under Rule 9(4) of the Rules through the counter affidavit. 13. Notwithstanding the above, the provisions of sub-Rules (4) and (5) of Rule 9 of the Rules, if read together in conjunction,would reveal that it is only for the default in payment of the balance auction amount within the period mentioned that the property could be resold and that the period of 15 days stipulated therein for the deposit of the balance sale amount may be extended, as may be agreed upon in writing. It means that first there has to be a default on part of the auction purchaser to invite cancellation of the auction and second, that the period of deposit stipulated therein is not absolute rather extendable with the agreement of the parties. 14. Sub-Rules (4) and (5) of Rule 9 of the Rules are extracted below: \"(4) The balance amount of purchase price payable shall be paid by the purchaser to the authorized officer on or before the fifteenth day of confirmation of sale of the immovable property or such extended period [as may be agreed upon in writing between the purchaser and the secured creditor, in any case not exceeding three months]. 4 [1978] 2 SCR 272 : (1978) 1 SCC 405 1378 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports (5) In default of payment within the period mentioned in sub-rule (4), the deposit shall be forfeited [to the secured creditor] and the property shall be resold and the defaulting purchaser shall forfeit all claim to the property or to any part of the sum for which it may be subsequently sold.\" 15. In Varimadugu Obi Reddy v. Sreenivasulu and Ors.,5 this Court while interpreting Rule 9(4) of the Rules observed that it refers to a period of 15 days for deposit of balance sale consideration or such extended period for which no outer limit has been prescribed. Therefore, it appears that the time stipulated therein is not sacrosanct and the period can be extended as agreed upon in writing by the parties. A similar view has also been expressed in an earlier decision of this Court in General Manager, Sri Siddeshwara Cooperative Bank Ltd. and Anr. v. Ikbal and Ors.6 wherein referring to Rule 9(4) of the Rules, it was held that the time for deposit stipulated therein is not sacrosanct and may be extended if there is a written agreement between the parties. 16. In the case at hand, the correspondence between the parties reveals that the respondents only sought extension of time for the reason that the appellant-Bank itself was not in a position to accept the amount as there was a complaint to the CBI, an advisory of the ED and a stay from the High Court. The silence on part of the appellant-Bank in either immediately revoking the sale confirmation or refusing to extend the time, impliedly amounted to extension of time in writing with consent. 17. Secondly, the non-deposit of the balance sale consideration within the time limit prescribed under Rule 9(4) was not attributable to the respondents so as to call them defaulters within the meaning of the provisions of Rule 9(4) and (5) of the Rules. 18. The correspondence on record clearly reveals that the respondents were always ready and willing to deposit the balance auction amount of Rs.1,06,50,000/- and had rather submitted a bank draft dated 15.10.2022 of the said amount and had requested for the issuance of the sale certificate and possession of the auction property. The said 5 [2022] 16 SCR 1108 : (2023) 2 SCC 168 6 [2013] 8 SCR 532 : (2013) 10 SCC 83 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1379 IDBI Bank Ltd. v. Ramswaroop Daliya and Ors. correspondence clearly establishes the bona fide of the respondents and it was only the appellant-Bank who had avoided the issuance of the sale certificate. There is no material on record to justify non- acceptance of the balance sale consideration from the respondents within 15 days of the confirmation of the sale and whatever pleas have been taken by the appellant-Bank to avoid acceptance are all subsequent and are not very material. 19. In these facts and circumstances, reason for the non-issuance of the sale certificate is solely attributable to the appellant-Bank and that there were no latches, negligence or default on part of the respondents in offering to deposit the balance auction amount. Since there is no default on their part, non-deposit of the said amount within the stipulated period would not be fatal within the meaning of sub-Rules (4) and (5) of Rule 9 of the Rules. 20. It is pertinent to mention here that the cancellation of the auction sale vide communication dated 24.12.2019 is purely unilateral in nature without any notice or opportunity of hearing to the respondents. The said cancellation as such is per se in violation of the principles of natural justice and is illegal. 21. Learned counsel for the appellant-Bank, relying upon Union Bank of India v. Rajat Infrastructure Private Limited and Others,7 had submitted that the statutory period prescribed under Rule 9(4) is not liable to be extended by this Court even in exercise of powers under Article 142 of the Constitution of India. In the said case, this Court accepted that though the plenary powers of the Supreme Court under Article 142 of the Constitution are inherent which are of very wide amplitude but the said power cannot be used to supplement the substantive law by ignoring the express statutory provision. The aforesaid authority cited on behalf of the appellant-Bank is not of any help to it in this case as we are not providing for any new period of limitation for depositing the balance sale consideration or extending the time period provided under the Rules. We are simply holding that the period to deposit the balance sale consideration, as provided under the Rules, is not sacrosanct and is extendable with the consent in writing of the parties and that Rule 9(4) will only come into play when there is default on part of the party i.e. the auction 7 [2023] 14 SCR 666 : (2023) 10 SCC 232\n\n1380 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports purchaser to deposit the amount and will not apply where there is no default or that the default, if any, lies upon the auctioneer i.e. appellant-Bank in the case at hand. 22. Accordingly, we are of the considered opinion that the High Court has not committed any error of law in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case in holding that the appellant-Bank manifestly erred in cancelling the auction sale dated 10.04.2018 and in directing to issue sale certificate/register the sale deed in favour of the respondents after getting the balance auction amount deposited within a period of four weeks. 23. In view of the foregoing,the civil appeals are dismissed with no order as to costs. 24. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of. Result of the case: Appeals dismissed. †Headnotes prepared by: Divya Pandey", "2024_10_1381_1403_EN": "[2024] 10 S.C.R. 1381 : 2024 INSC 784 The Patna Municipal Corporation & Ors. v.

(Civil Appeal No. 11117 of 2024) 16 October 2024 [Vikram Nath and Ahsanuddin Amanullah,* JJ.] Issue for Consideration The Division Bench of the High Court set aside the judgment of the Single Judge of the High Court and held that the appellant(s) herein could not raise any demand of tax/fee/royalty on advertisement(s) since it has been made without any legislative sanction and is, thus, violative of Article 265 of the Constitution of India. The core question confronting this Court, as it was before the Division Bench, is whether the demand is by way of a tax/levy or simply in the nature of royalty for permission for advertising through hoardings within the limits of the Corporation.

M/s Tribro Ad Bureau & Ors. been set aside and it has been held that the appellant(s) herein could not raise any demand of tax/fee/royalty on advertisement(s) since it has been made without any legislative sanction and is, thus, violative of Article 2651 of the Constitution of India, 1950 (hereinafter referred to as the \"Constitution\"). The Division Bench further directed that all amounts recovered by the appellants herein on this count i.e., by way of 'tax' on advertisement(s), be refunded to the concerned parties, as also that, as a consequence, there was no question of any imposition of penalty by the Appellant No.1/the Patna Municipal Corporation (hereinafter referred to as the \"Corporation\"). CONTEXT: 6. On 29.08.2005, a Meeting was called by the Appellant No.2/Municipal Commissioner-cum-Chief Executive Officer, attended by representatives of the advertising agencies (respective Respondents No.1), wherein it was resolved that if any agency puts up its advertisement(s), it will have to submit a list of advertisement(s), the place/location, size, etc. to the Authorised Officer of the Corporation, and that the Corporation would charge royalty at the rate of Re.1/- per square foot per year on such hoardings, which would be displayed on the land under the jurisdiction of the Corporation. The Appellants on 15.01.2007 came out with fresh rates of royalty/tax on advertisements whereby different rates of royalty for different kinds of hoardings and advertisements were prescribed, the same being Rs.10/- per square foot per year in the case of the respondent, which was made effective from 02.11.2007. 7. In the interregnum, the Patna Municipal Corporation Act, 1951 was repealed and replaced by the Bihar Municipal Act, 2007 (hereinafter referred to as the \"Act\"), which came into force with effect from 05.04.2007, vide Section 488(1) of the Act. Thus, the Corporation started operating under the (new) Act. By Office Order dated 02.11.2007, various rates of royalty/penalty under the provisions of the Act were prescribed and the order was made effective from 24.08.2007. The Municipal Commissioner of the Corporation recommended that all those advertisers who had not paid their dues in terms of the order dated 02.11.2007 would be liable to be charged twice the rate fixed and further that hoardings displayed without permission should be removed and such persons would be charged 1 '265. Taxes not to be imposed save by authority of law. - No tax shall be levied or collected except by authority of law.' 1386 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports a penalty five times the amount due from them. On 15.12.2010, the Council of the Corporation passed Resolution No.18 to cancel the registration of the advertising agencies that had defaulted in making payment of the enhanced royalty/fee/tax. The same was done when it came to the notice of the Corporation that several advertising agencies had illegally displayed hoardings, with some not even having permission to do so from the Corporation and not having paid dues. On 11.02.2012, in terms of various Resolutions/ decisions of the Corporation under the Act, a demand was raised towards royalty/fee/tax on the Respondent No.1 to the tune of Rs.64,50,040/- (Rupees Sixty-Four Lakhs Fifty Thousand and Forty). This demand, as also the Office Order dated 02.11.2007 was assailed by filing a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution before the Patna High Court, wherein the learned Single Judge ultimately went on to quash 'the order of demand of penalty by the Patna Municipal Corporation in all the cases'and directed 'that the Patna Municipal Corporation should accept the tax/royalty/rent payable by these petitioners in accordance with the 2007 rates fixed by the Patna Municipal Corporation.' On 18.07.2012, the Corporation sent a Demand Notice to the Respondent No.1 to pay Rs.21,98,000/- (Rupees Twenty One Lakhs Ninety Eight Thousand) as royalty/fee/ tax in light of the Single Bench Judgment, to which the Respondent No.1 replied on 28.01.2013 contending that the same was calculated wrongly and, thus, a corrected Demand Notice ought to be sent. As the Corporation did not respond to this, the Respondent No.1 continued paying royalty/fee/tax as self-assessed by it i.e. at the rate of Re.1 per square foot. 8. The Respondent No.1 and others, similarly-situated, preferred intra- Court appeal(s) before the Division Bench of the High Court assailing the Single Bench Judgment. The Division Bench, by way of the Impugned Judgment, quashed the enhancement itself, and held that the Corporation had no power to charge royalty/fee/tax under the Act, since it was necessary to frame Regulations. The Impugned Judgment reasoned that in the absence of such Regulations, there was no authority in law to levy/impose/collect tax, as sought to be imposed by the Corporation. Apropos the Regulations framed on 04.07.2012, published in the Gazette on 13.08.2012, the Division Bench held that the said Regulations pertain only to licensing provisions and not taxing provisions. It added that when the Regulations were silent and do not speak of tax on advertisement, the same could not be levied [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1387 The Patna Municipal Corporation & Ors. v. M/s Tribro Ad Bureau & Ors. by the Corporation. It further went on to hold that even the decision of the Corporation to auction-settle the right to collect advertisement tax from advertisers to private individuals is totally impermissible as the State/its instrumentalities cannot trade in taxation. The Division Bench was of the view that to levy, assess and raise any demand of tax is a sovereign function, which cannot be auction-settled to private individuals. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS: 9. Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that on 29.08.2005, the Corporation had taken a decision with regard to imposition of royalty in the Meeting held with representatives of advertising agency/cies. It was agreed that advertisers would make payment of royalty to the Corporation at the rate of Re.1 per square foot per annum based on the area of the hoardings concerned. Thus, it was submitted that the issue is limited only to charging of royalty and there is no imposition of any kind of tax, as has been erroneously held by the Single Bench as also by the Division Bench. It was submitted that on 02.11.2007, the Corporation issued an Office Order whereby the rate of royalty was increased from Re.1 per square foot per annum to Rs.10 per square foot per annum. It was further submitted that on 18.07.2009, a Meeting was held between the Corporation (headed by the Appellant No.2) and representatives of advertisers, where there was no opposition to the proposal afore-noted. However, learned senior counsel contended that since the royalty was not being paid, in the year 2011, the Appellant No.2 recommended the imposition of penalty on the arrears due from the advertisers. 10. He further submitted that on 15.12.2010, in the General Meeting of the Corporation, it was decided that the registration of such defaulting advertising agency(ies) be cancelled, and this was followed-up by the Corporation raising demand for payment of arrears of royalty from the concerned advertisers, including Respondent No.1, in whose case it was to the tune of Rs.64,50,040/- (Rupees Sixty Four Lakhs Fifty Thousand and Forty). Learned counsel further submitted that only at this belated stage, the Respondent No.1 preferred CWJC No.5108 of 2012, wherein Office Order dated 02.11.2007 as well as the Demand Notice dated 11.02.2012 were assailed. 11. Learned counsel submitted that by a detailed and comprehensive judgment, the learned Single Judge upheld the levy of charge by the 1388 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Corporation and only the demand of penalty was interfered with. It was submitted that the learned Single Judge even observed that the writ petitioners before it, including Respondent No.1, were liable to pay the amount due to the Corporation in easy instalments in intervals of four months to be fixed by the Appellant-Corporation. Thus, learned counsel contended that in conformity with the Single Bench Judgment, the Corporation raised fresh demand on Respondent No.1 under letter dated 18.07.2012 for Rs.21,98,000/- (Rupees Twenty One Lakhs Ninety Eight Thousand). However, it was submitted that the Respondent No.1 deposited only a sum of Rs.50,000/- (Rupees Fifty Thousand) on 21.07.2012. At this juncture, learned counsel for Respondent No.1 submitted that Respondent No.1 on 28.01.2013 had disputed the demand of Rs.21,98,000/- (Rupees Twenty One Lakhs Ninety Eight Thousand) and self-assessed the dues to be Rs.1,57,050/- (Rupees One Lakh Fifty Seven Thousand and Fifty) and after adjusting the amount already paid, calculated the payment to be made in three instalments of Rs.28,767/- (Rupees Twenty Eight Thousand Seven Hundred Sixty Seven) each, which Respondent No.1 paid on 28.01.2013, 29.05.2013 and 28.09.2013 by Draft(s). Further, learned counsel for Respondent No.1 pointed out that on 30.03.2013, the Respondent No.1, on the same terms, self-assessed the royalties for the years 2012-2013, 2013-2014 and 2014-2015, as Rs.48,600/-, Rs.48,600/- and Rs.31,000/-, respectively and deposited the same on 30.03.2013, 31.03.2014 and 31.03.2015. It was also stated that, in the meantime, Respondent No.1 had approached the Division Bench against the Single Bench Judgment by instituting LPA No.1391 of 2012, leading to the Impugned Judgment. 12. Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the simple and basic issue was the payment of royalty, as agreed to and accepted by the parties. It was stated that payments were also made, which now have been given the colour of being demand/imposition of tax, which, learned counsel contended, is absolutely not the case. It was urged that the only issue, which at best could have been gone into by the High Court, was with regard to the quantum of enhancement from Re.1 per square foot to Rs.10 per square foot, but the imposition, on the head of \"royalty\", could not have been termed as \"imposition of tax\", as admittedly borne out from the record itself. It was further advanced that charge of royalty by the Corporation was also in terms of an agreement entered into between the parties, which was admitted by them in appellate proceedings before the Division Bench. [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1389 The Patna Municipal Corporation & Ors. v. M/s Tribro Ad Bureau & Ors. 13. Learned counsel submitted that \"royalty\" and \"tax\" have different connotations in law and royalty, unlike tax, is not based on any statutory provision, but on agreement between the parties. Further, it was stated that the enhancement of the rate of royalty to Rs.10 per square foot from Re.1 per square foot, notified under Office Order dated 02.11.2007 was challenged by the Respondent No.1 only in the year 2012. By its advertisement issued on 15.01.2007, the Corporation came out with fresh rates of royalty on advertisements which were accepted by the Respondent No.1 and were made effective from 02.11.2007 at the rate of Rs.10 per square foot. 14. Learned counsel in support of the above has relied upon the decisions of this Court in Indsil Hydro Power and Manganese Limited v State of Kerala (2021) 10 SCC 165, the relevant being Paragraphs 50 to 56;2 Century Spinning and Manufacturing Company Ltd. 2 '50. In State of W.B. v. Kesoram Industries Ltd. [State of W.B. v. Kesoram Industries Ltd. (2004) 10 SCC 201] , another Constitution Bench of this Court explained certain observations in India Cement Ltd. v. State of T.N. [India Cement Ltd. v. State of T.N. (1990) 1 SCC 12] , and stated as under : (Kesoram Industries case [State of W.B. v. Kesoram Industries Ltd. (2004) 10 SCC 201] , SCC pp. 293-95 & 297, paras 59-61 & 71) \"59. First we will refer to certain dictionaries oft-cited in courts of law: Words and Phrases, Permanent Edn. (Vol. 37-A, p. 597): '\"Royalty\" is the share of the produce reserved to owner for permitting another to exploit and use property. The word \"royalty\" means compensation paid to landlord by occupier of land for species of occupation allowed by contract between them. \"Royalty\" is a share of the product or profit (as of a mine, forest, etc.) reserved by the owner for permitting another to use his property.' Stroud's Judicial Dictionary of Words and Phrases (6th Edn., 2000, Vol. 3, p. 2341): 'The word \"royalties\" signifies, in mining leases, that part of the reddendum which is variable, and depends upon the quantity of minerals gotten or the agreed payment to a patentee on every article made according to the patent. Rights or privileges for which remuneration is payable in the for , Vol. 3, p. 2341): 'The word \"royalties\" signifies, in mining leases, that part of the reddendum which is variable, and depends upon the quantity of minerals gotten or the agreed payment to a patentee on every article made according to the patent. Rights or privileges for which remuneration is payable in the form of a royalty.' Words and Phrases, Legally Defined (3rd Edn., 1990, Vol. 4, p. 112): 'A royalty, in the sense in which the word is used in connection with mining leases, is a payment to the lessor proportionate to the amount of the demised mineral worked within a specified period.' Wharton's Law Lexicon (14th Edn., p. 893): 'Royalty.--Payment to a patentee by agreement on every article made according to his patent; or to an author by a publisher on every copy of his book sold; or to the owner of minerals for the right of working the same on every ton or other weight raised.' Mozley & Whiteley's Law Dictionary (11th Edn., 1993, p. 243): 'A pro rata payment to a grantor or lessor, on the working of the property leased, or otherwise on the profits of the grant or lease. The word is especially used in reference to mines, patents and copyrights.' Prem's Judicial Dictionary (1992, Vol. 2, p. 1458): 'Royalties are payments which the Government may demand for the appropriation of minerals, timber or other property belonging to the Government. Two important features of royalty have to be noticed, they are, that the payment made for the privilege of removing the articles is in proportion to the quantity removed, and the basis of the payment is an agreement.' Black's Law Dictionary (7th Edn., p. 1330): 'Royalty.--A share of the product or profit from real property, reserved by the grantor of a mineral lease, in exchange for the lessee's right to mine or drill on the land. Mineral royalty.--A right to a share of income from mineral production.' 60. In D.K. Trivedi & Sons v. State of Gujarat [D.K. Trivedi & Sons v. State of Gujarat, 1986 Supp SCC 20] a Bench of two learned Judges of this Court dealt with \"rent\", \"royalty\" and \"dead rent\" and held as follows 1390 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports : (SCC pp. 53-54, paras 38-39) '38. Rent is an integral part of the concept of a lease. It is the consideration moving from the lessee to the lessor for demise of the property to him.… *** 39. In a mining lease the consideration usually moving from the lessee to the lessor is the rent for the area leased (often called surface rent), dead rent and royalty. Since the mining lease confers upon the lessee the right not merely to enjoy the property as under an ordinary lease but also to extract minerals from the land and to appropriate them for his own use or benefit, in addition to the usual rent for the area demised, the lessee is required to pay a certain amount in respect of the minerals extracted proportionate to the quantity so extracted. Such payment is called \"royalty\". It may, however, be that the mine is not worked properly so as not to yield enough return to the lessor in the shape of royalty. In order to ensure for the lessor a regular income, regardless of whether the mine is worked or not, a fixed amount is provided to be paid to him by the lessee. This is called \"dead rent\". \"Dead rent\" is calculated on the basis of the area leased while royalty is calculated on the quantity of minerals extracted or removed. Thus, while dead rent is a fixed return to the lessor, royalty is a return which varies with the quantity of minerals extracted or removed. Since dead rent and royalty are both a return to the lessor in respect of the area leased, looked at from one point of view dead rent can be described as the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty payable to the lessor but calculated on the basis of the area leased and not on the quantity of minerals extracted or removed.' In H.R.S. Murthy v. Collector [H.R.S. Murthy v. Collector, AIR 1965 SC 177 : (1964) 6 SCR 666] too the Constitution Bench of this Court had defined \"royalty\" to mean 'the payment made for the materials or minerals won from the land'. 61. The judicial opinion as prevailing amongst the High Courts may be noticed. A Full Bench of the High Court of Orissa held in Laxmi Narayan Agarwalla v. State of Orissa [Laxmi Narayan Agarwalla v. State of Orissa, 1983 SCC OnLine Ori 16 : AIR 1983 Ori 210 : (1983) 55 CLT 362] , SCC OnLine Ori para 12 : AIR a e noticed. A Full Bench of the High Court of Orissa held in Laxmi Narayan Agarwalla v. State of Orissa [Laxmi Narayan Agarwalla v. State of Orissa, 1983 SCC OnLine Ori 16 : AIR 1983 Ori 210 : (1983) 55 CLT 362] , SCC OnLine Ori para 12 : AIR at p. 224, para 12 '[R]oyalty is the payment made for the minerals extracted. It is not tax.' In Surajdin v. State of M.P. [Surajdin v. State of M.P., 1959 SCC OnLine MP 19 : AIR 1960 MP 129 : 1960 MPLJ 39] a Division Bench of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh referred to Wharton's Law Lexicon and Mozley & Whiteley's Law Dictionary and said (at AIR p. 130, para 7) 'royalties are payments which the Government may demand for the appropriation of minerals, timber or other property belonging to the Government'. The High Court opined that there are two important features of royalty : (i) the payment is in proportion to the quantity removed; and (ii) the basis of the payment is an agreement. *** 71. We have clearly pointed out the said error, as we are fully convinced in that regard and feel ourselves obliged constitutionally, legally and morally to do so, lest the said error should cause any further harm to the trend of jurisprudential thought centring around the meaning of \"royalty\". We hold that royalty is not tax. Royalty is paid to the owner of land who may be a private person and may not necessarily be a State. A private person owning the land is entitled to charge royalty but not tax. The lessor receives royalty as his income and for the lessee the royalty paid is an expenditure incurred. Royalty cannot be tax. We declare that even in India Cement Ltd. [India Cement Ltd. v. State of T.N. (1990) 1 SCC 12] it was not the finding of the Court that royalty is a tax. A statement caused by an apparent typographical or inadvertent error in a judgment of the Court should not be misunderstood as declaration of such law by the Court. We also record our express dissent with that part of the judgment in Mahalaxmi Fabric Mills Ltd. [State of M.P. v. Mahalaxmi Fabric Mills Ltd., 1995 Supp (1) SCC 642] which says (vide para 12 of SCC report) that there was no \"typographical error\" in India Cement [India Cement Ltd. v. State of T.N. (1990) 1 SCC 12] and that the said conclusion that royalty is a tax logically fle . v. Mahalaxmi Fabric Mills Ltd., 1995 Supp (1) SCC 642] which says (vide para 12 of SCC report) that there was no \"typographical error\" in India Cement [India Cement Ltd. v. State of T.N. (1990) 1 SCC 12] and that the said conclusion that royalty is a tax logically flew from the earlier paragraphs of the judgment.\" 51. In State of H.P. v. Gujarat Ambuja Cement Ltd. [State of H.P. v. Gujarat Ambuja Cement Ltd. (2005) 6 SCC 499] , a Bench of three Judges of this Court observed : (SCC pp. 530-31, paras 44-46) \"44. \"Royalty\" is not a term used in legal parlance for the price of the goods sold. It is a payment reserved by the grantor of a patent, lease of a mine or similar right, and payable proportionately to the use made of the right by the grantee as held in Titaghur Paper Mills Co. Ltd. case [State of Orissa v. Titaghur Paper Mills Co. Ltd., 1985 Supp SCC 280 : 1985 SCC (Tax) 538] . 45. In its primary and natural sense \"royalty\" in the legal world, is known as the equivalent or translation of \"jura regalia\" or \"jura regia\". Royal rights and prerogatives of a sovereign are covered thereunder. In its secondary sense, the word \"royalty\" would signify, as in mining leases, that part of the reddendum, [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1391 The Patna Municipal Corporation & Ors. v. M/s Tribro Ad Bureau & Ors. variable though, payable in cash or kind, for rights and privileges obtained. (See Inderjeet Singh Sial v. Karam Chand Thapar [Inderjeet Singh Sial v. Karam Chand Thapar (1995) 6 SCC 166] .) 46. \"Royalty\" is not a tax. Simply because the royalty is levied by reference to the quantity of the minerals produced and the impugned cess too is quantified by taking into consideration the same quantity of the mineral produced, the latter does not become royalty. The former is the rent of the land on which the mine is situated or the price of the privilege of winning the minerals from the land parted with by the Government in favour of the mining lessee. The cess is a levy on mineral rights with impact on the land and quantified by reference to the quantum of mineral produced. The distinction, though fine, yet exists and is perceptible. (See State of W.B. v. Kesoram Industries Ltd. [State of W.B. v. Kesoram Industries Ltd. (2004) 10 SCC 201] )\" 52. On the essential characteristics of a tax, the following observations of Banumathi, J. in the concurring opinion in Jindal Stainless Ltd. v. State of Haryana [Jindal Stainless Ltd. v. State of Haryana (2017) 12 SCC 1] cull out the essence : (SCC p. 297, para 334) \"334. The essential characteristics of a tax are that : (i) it is imposed under a statutory power without the taxpayer's consent and the payment is enforced by law; (ii) it is an imposition made for public purpose without reference to any special benefit to be conferred on the payer of the tax; and (iii) it is part of the common burden. In Commr., Hindu Religious Endowments v. Sri Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar of Sri Shirur Mutt[Commr., Hindu Religious Endowments v. Sri Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar of Sri Shirur Mutt, 1954 SCR 1005 : AIR 1954 SC 282] , the Constitution Bench has laid down the characteristics of a tax which has since been consistently followed and it is as under : (AIR p. 295, para 43) '43. … \"A tax\" … \"is a compulsory exaction of money by a public authority for public purposes enforceable by law and is not payment \"for services rendered\".\" This definition brings out, in all opinion, the essential characteristics of a tax as distinguished from other forms of imposition which, in a general sense, are included within it. It is said that th a compulsory exaction of money by a public authority for public purposes enforceable by law and is not payment \"for services rendered\".\" This definition brings out, in all opinion, the essential characteristics of a tax as distinguished from other forms of imposition which, in a general sense, are included within it. It is said that the essence of taxation is compulsion, that is to say, it is imposed under statutory power without the taxpayer's consent and the payment is enforced by law.… The second characteristic of tax is that it is an imposition made for public purpose without reference to any special benefit to be conferred on the payer of the tax. This is expressed by saying that the levy of tax is for the purposes of general revenue, which when collected forms part of the public revenues of the State. As the object of a tax is not to confer any special benefit upon any particular individual there is, as it is said, no element of \"quid pro quo\" between the taxpayer and the public authority,… Another feature of taxation is that as it is a part of the common burden, the quantum of imposition upon the taxpayer depends generally upon his capacity to pay.' \" 53. It is true that as a result of order passed by this Court in Mineral Area Development Authority v. Steel Authority of India [Mineral Area Development Authority v. Steel Authority of India (2011) 4 SCC 450] , certain questions concerning \"royalty\" as determined under the provisions of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 now stand referred to a Bench of nine Judges, which reference is still pending consideration. However, none of those issues arise in the present matter. 54. On the use of the expression \"royalty\" in a contract, we may note the following observations in Inderjeet Singh Sial v. Karam Chand Thapar [Inderjeet Singh Sial v. Karam Chand Thapar (1995) 6 SCC 166] : (SCC p. 173, paras 12-13) \"12. … The word \"royalty\" thus, in the deed was used in a loose sense so as to convey liability to make periodic payments to the assignor for the period during which the lease would subsist; payments dependent on the coal gotten and extracted in quantities or on dispatch. We have therefore to construe document Ext. D-5 on its own terms and not barely on the label or description given to the stipulated payments. Conceivably this arrangement could well have been given a shape by using another word. The word \"royalty\" was perhaps more handy for the authors t s or on dispatch. We have therefore to construe document Ext. D-5 on its own terms and not barely on the label or description given to the stipulated payments. Conceivably this arrangement could well have been given a shape by using another word. The word \"royalty\" was perhaps more handy for the authors to be employed for an arrangement like this, so as to ensure periodic payments. In no event could the parties be put to blame for using the word \"royalty\" as if arrogating to themselves the royal or sovereign right of the State and then make redundant the rights and obligations created by the deed. 13. The commodity goes by its value; not by the wrapper in which it is packed. A man is known for his worth; not for the clothes he wears. Royal robes worn by a beggar would not make him a king. The document is weighed by its content, not the title. One needs to go to the value, not the glitter. All the same, we do not wish to minimise the importance of the right words to be used in documents. What we mean to express is that if the thought is clear, its translation in words, spoken or written, may, more often than not, tend to be faulty. More so in a language which is not the mother tongue. Those faulted words 1392 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports cannot bounce back to alter the thought. Thus in sum and substance when the contracting parties and the draftsman are assumed to have known that the word \"royalty\" is meant to be employed to secure for the State something out of what the State conveys, their employment of that word for private ensuring was not intended to confer on the assignor the status of the sovereign or the State, and on that basis have the document voided.\" 55. We may also note the following observations from the decision of a Bench of three Judges of this Court in Union of India v. Motion Picture Assn. [Union of India v. Motion Picture Assn. (1999) 6 SCC 150] , where the payment of fee was under the terms of a contract between the parties : (SCC pp. 169-71, paras 31-32) \"31. The exhibitors also contend that the charge of one per cent on the net recoveries is a compulsory exaction in the form of a tax. Neither the Act nor the provisions of the licence stipulate payment of any such tax. Hence imposition of this amount is in violation of Article 265 of the Constitution. It is true that neither the relevant Act nor the notification nor the rules nor the terms and conditions of the licence stipulate the payment of any rental. This amount is required to be paid under an agreement which the exhibitors individually enter into with the Films Division for the supply of these films. It is a payment under the terms of a contract between the two parties. It cannot, therefore, be viewed as a tax at all. The exhibitors contend that because they are required to enter into these agreements, any payment under the agreement is a compulsory exaction and is, therefore, tax. We do not agree. Under the terms of the agreement, the Films Division has to supply certain prints to the theatre owners at stated intervals. The Films Division is required to maintain a distribution network for this purpose. It is required to pack these films and is required to allow the exhibitors to retain these films in their possession for a certain period. The films are to be returned to the Films Division thereafter. The charge is termed in the agreement as rental for the films. It covers charges for preparing the prints of the films for distribution, and for packing them for delivery. These are clearly services rendered by the Films Division for which it is paid one per cent of the net collection as a rental. As stated earlier, th . The charge is termed in the agreement as rental for the films. It covers charges for preparing the prints of the films for distribution, and for packing them for delivery. These are clearly services rendered by the Films Division for which it is paid one per cent of the net collection as a rental. As stated earlier, the total cost of preparing prints, packing them and distributing them is much higher than the total recovery made by the Films Division by way of rental from all the exhibitors. There is a clear nexus between the services rendered and the payment to be made. The payment, therefore, is in the nature of a fee rather than a tax though there may not be an exact quid pro quo. Nevertheless the element of quid pro quo is very much present. 32. The exhibitors relied upon a number of cases which distinguish a tax from a fee. We will only refer to some of them. In District Council, Jowai Autonomous District v. Dwet Singh Rymbai [District Council, Jowai Autonomous District v. Dwet Singh Rymbai (1986) 4 SCC 38 : 1986 SCC (Tax) 768] this Court held that a compulsory exaction for public purposes would amount to a tax while a payment for services rendered would amount to a fee. On the facts in that case, the Court said that there was no element of quid pro quo which will justify the imposition of royalty as a fee. In Commr., Hindu Religious Endowments v. Sri Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar of Sri Shirur Mutt [Commr., Hindu Religious Endowments v. Sri Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar of Sri Shirur Mutt, 1954 SCR 1005 : AIR 1954 SC 282] this Court as far back as in 1954, laid down the distinction between a tax and a fee. This Court has described a tax as a compulsory exaction for public purposes which does not require the taxpayer's consent; while fee is a charge for specific service to some, and it must have some relation to the expenses incurred for the service. In Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority v. Sharadkumar Jayantikumar Pasawalla [Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority v. Sharadkumar Jayantikumar Pasawalla (1992) 3 SCC 285] this Court has said that an express authorisation for the levy of a fee is necessary. In the present case, however, the rental is charged by the Films Division by virtue of an agreement between the Films Division and the individual exhibitor. This is in consideration of the Films Division supplying films to the exhibitor, packing the film and arranging for it n for the levy of a fee is necessary. In the present case, however, the rental is charged by the Films Division by virtue of an agreement between the Films Division and the individual exhibitor. This is in consideration of the Films Division supplying films to the exhibitor, packing the film and arranging for its delivery. This is clearly an agreed fee charged for rendering services. It cannot be viewed as a compulsory exaction or as a tax. There is a statutory obligation which is cast on the exhibitors to exhibit certain films. To carry out this statutory obligation, if the exhibitors enter into an agreement with the Films Division and agree to pay a certain amount of rental for procuring the films from the Films Division to comply with the statutory obligation, the levy must, since it is correlated with the Films Division discharging certain obligations under the contract, be viewed, at the highest, as a fee and not as a tax. It is an agreed payment, and is not unreasonable. The High Court [Motion Picture Assn. v. Union of India, 1995 SCC OnLine Del 600 : (1995) 60 DLT 180] has rightly negatived the contention of the respondent exhibitors.\" 56. Thus, the expression \"royalty\" has consistently been construed to be compensation paid for rights and privileges enjoyed by the grantee and normally has its genesis in the agreement entered into between the grantor and the grantee. As against tax which is imposed under a statutory power without reference to any special benefit to be conferred on the payer of the tax, the royalty would be in terms [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1393 The Patna Municipal Corporation & Ors. v. M/s Tribro Ad Bureau & Ors. v Ulhasnagar Municipal Council (1970) 1 SCC 582, the relevant being Paragraph 11,3 and; Union of India v Indo-Afghan Agencies Ltd. (1968) 2 SCR 366, the relevant being Paragraphs 10 and 24.4 of the agreement between the parties and normally has direct relationship with the benefit or privilege conferred upon the grantee.' 3 '11. Public bodies are as much bound as private individuals to carry out representations of facts and promises made by them, relying on which other persons have altered their position to their prejudice. The obligation arising against an individual out of his representation amounting to a promise may be enforced ex contracts by a person who acts upon the promise: when the law requires that a contract enforceable at law against a public body shall be in certain form or be executed in the manner prescribed by statute, the obligation may if the contract be not in that form be enforced against it in appropriate cases in equity. In Union of India v. Indo-Afghan Agencies Ltd. [(1968) 2 SCR 366] this Court held that the Government is not exempt from the equity arising out of the acts done by citizens to their prejudice, relying upon the representations as to its future conduct made by the Government. This Court held that the following observations made by Denning, J., in Robertson v. Minister of Pensions [(1949) 1 KB 227] applied in India: \"The Crown cannot escape by saying that estoppels do not bind the Crown for that doctrine has long been exploded. Nor can the Crown escape by praying in aid the doctrine of executive necessity, that is, the doctrine that the Crown cannot bind itself so as to fetter its future executive action.\" We are in this case not concerned to deal with the question whether Denning, L.J., was right in extending the rule to a different class of cases as in Falmouth Boat Construction Co. Ltd. v. Howell [(1950) 1 All ER 538] where he observed at p. 542: \"Whenever Government officers in their dealings with a subject take on themselves to assume authority in a matter with which the subject is concerned, he is entitled to rely on their having the authority which they assume. He does not know, and cannot be expected to know, the limits of their authority, and he ought not to suffer if they exceed it.\" It may be sufficient to observe that in appeal from that judgmen h the subject is concerned, he is entitled to rely on their having the authority which they assume. He does not know, and cannot be expected to know, the limits of their authority, and he ought not to suffer if they exceed it.\" It may be sufficient to observe that in appeal from that judgment (Howell v. Falmouth Boat Construction Co. Ltd.) Lord Simonds observed after referring to the observations of Denning, L.J.: \"The illegality of an act is the same whether the action has been misled by an assumption of authority on the part of a Government officer however high or low in the hierachy. * * * The question is whether the character of an act done in force of a statutory prohibition is affected by the fact that it had been induced by a misleading assumption of authority. In my opinion the answer is clearly: No.\"' 4 '10. This observation is, \"clearly very wide and it is difficult to determine its proper scope\" : Anson's English Law of Contract, 22nd Edn., p. 174. It may also be noticed that before Rowlatt, J., the applicants claimed enforcement of a contract against the Crown, and the learned Judge came to the conclusion that there was no contract and no damages could be awarded. In Robertson v. Minister of Pensions [(1949) 1 KB 227] Denning, J. observed at p. 231: \"The Crown cannot escape by saying that estoppels do not bind the Crown for that doctrine has long been exploded. Nor can the Crown escape by praying in aid the doctrine of executive necessity, that is, the doctrine that the Crown cannot bind itself so as to fetter its future executive action. That doctrine was propounded by Rowlatt, J., in Rederiaktiebolaget Amphitrite v. King but it was unnecessary for the decision because the statement there was not a promise which was intended to be binding but only an expression of intention. Rowlatt, J., seems to have been influenced by the cases on the right of the Crown to dismiss its servants at pleasure, but those cases must now all be read in the light of the judgment of Lord Atkin in Reilly v. King [(1954) AC 176, 179] . … In my opinion the defence of executive necessity is of limited scope. It only avails the Crown where there is an implied term to that effect or that is the true meaning of the contract.\" Denning, J., was dealing with a case of a serving army officer, who wrote to the War Office regarding a disability and receive n the defence of executive necessity is of limited scope. It only avails the Crown where there is an implied term to that effect or that is the true meaning of the contract.\" Denning, J., was dealing with a case of a serving army officer, who wrote to the War Office regarding a disability and received a reply that his disability had been accepted as attributable to \"military service\". Relying on that assurance he forbore to obtain an independent medical opinion. The Minister of Pensions later decided that the appellant's disability could not be attributed to war service. It was held that as between subjects such an assurance would be enforceable because it was intended to be binding intended to be acted upon, and was in fact acted upon; and the assurance was also binding on the Crown because no term could be implied that the Crown was at liberty to revoke it. xxx 1394 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports SUBMISSIONS BY THE RESPONDENT(S) NO.1: 15. Per contra, learned counsel for Respondent No.1 submitted that the Impugned Judgment has dealt with all relevant aspects and is legally and factually correct, needing no interference. 16. It was submitted that the Division Bench rightly held that tax could not be levied by the Corporation, as such power cannot be exercised by the Corporation on its own, as it is in the domain of the Legislature to confer such power, which has not been done. It was further submitted that absence of such power coupled with the fact, that no procedure was adopted before such imposition, would be fatal, as the same cannot be arbitrarily enforced, in the absence of either a provision in law or without any procedure adopted, much less that sanctioned by Regulations, finally made/approved by the State Government as per the provisions of the Act. 17. It was emphasised that under Section 1465 of the Act, there has to 24. Under our jurisprudence the Government is not exempt from liability to carry out the representation made by it as to its future conduct and it cannot on some undefined and undisclosed ground of necessity or expediency fail to carry out the promise solemnly made by it, nor claim to be the judge of its own obligation to the citizen on an ex parte appraisement of the circumstances in which the obligation has arisen. We agree with the High Court that the impugned order passed by the Textile Commissioner and confirmed by the Central Government imposing cut in the import entitlement by the respondents should be set aside and quashed and that the Textile Commissioner and the Joint Chief Controller of Imports and Exports be directed to issue to the respondents import certificates for the total amount equal to 100% of the f.o.b. value of the goods exported by them, unless there is some decision which fails within clause 10 of the Scheme in question.' 5 '146. Licence for use of site for purpose of advertisement.-(1) Except under, and in conformity with, such terms and conditions of a licence as the Municipality may, by the regulations, provide, no person being the owner, lessee, sub-lessee, occupier or advertising agent shall use, or allow to be used, any site in any land, building or wall, or erect, or allow to be erected, on any site any hoarding, frame, post, kiosk, structure, vehicle, neon-sign or sky-sign for the purpose of display of any advertisement. (2) For the purpose of advertisement, every person- (a) using any site before the commencement of this Act, within ninety days from the date of such commencement, or (b) intending to use any site, or (c) whose licence for use of any site is about to expire. shall apply for a licence or renewal of licence, as the case may be, to the Chief Municipal Officer in such Form as may be specified by the Municipality. (3) The Chief Municipal Officer shall, after making such inspection as may be necessary and within thirty days of the receipt of the application, grant or renew a licence, as the case may be, on payment of such fee as may be determined by regulations, or refuse or cancel a licence, as the case may be. (4) The Chief Municipal Officer may, if, in his opinion, the proposed site for any advertisement is unsuitable from the considerations of public safety, traffic hazards or aesthetic design, refuse to grant a licence, or to renew any existing licence, within thirty days of the receipt of the application. (5) Every licence shall be for a period of one year except in the case of sites used for any temporary congregation of whatever nature including fairs, festivals, circus, yatra, exhibitions, sports events, or cultural or social programmes. (6) The Chief Municipal Officer shall cause to be maintained a register wherein the licences issued under this Section shall be separately recorded in respect of advertisement sites- [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1395 The Patna Municipal Corporation & Ors. v. M/s Tribro Ad Bureau & Ors. be a licence for exhibition of advertisement, and it shall be in terms of the Regulations framed therein. 18. Learned counsel submitted that the Regulations for licensing for the purpose of advertisement were issued only on 13.08.2012 whereas the Demand Notice was dated 11.02.2012, i.e. much prior to the Regulations for licence being framed. Thus, it was his contention that there was no power to charge any fee prior to 13.08.2012, in view of the Regulations framed under Section 146 of the Act, which, inter alia, also provided for licence for purposes of advertisement. Moreover, it was submitted that Section 147 of the Act provides for tax on advertisement, which also is to be determined as per the Regulations. 19. However, it was contended that in the present case, there is no Regulation for levy of taxes in terms of Section 147 read with Section 423 of the Act. In absence thereof, the Corporation could not have acted in the manner it did. 20. Learned counsel submitted that there being no statutory backing of law to issue the Office Order dated 02.11.2007, the demand raised under such order is a nullity as there is neither any agreement nor statutory force to raise such demand and moreover, the said Office Order does not speak about any licence fee as licence also could not have been granted without framing the Regulations. It was further submitted that no recovery of any demand can be made by an executive order unless it has legislative backing. 21. Learned counsel submitted that the charging Rs.10 per square foot irrespective of whether such hoardings are on private or public place is also arbitrary and unsustainable. In support of his contentions, learned counsel relied upon the decisions of this Court in Commissioner of Income Tax, Mumbai v Anjum M H Ghaswala (2002) 1 SCC 633; Punit Rai v Dinesh Chaudhary (2003) 8 SCC 204; Union of India v Naveen Jindal (2004) 2 SCC 510, and; State of Kerala v Chandramohanan (2004) 3 SCC 429. (a) on telephone, telegraph, tram, electric or other posts or poles erected on or along public or private streets or public places, (b) in lands or buildings, and (c) in cinema-halls, theatres or other places of public resort.' 1396 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports ANALYSIS, REASONING AND CONCLUSION: 22. Having given our anxious thought to the issue at hand, the Court finds that the judgment impugned warrants interference. Though the Division Bench has elaborated on the law relating to imposition of tax/levy, we find that the issue was not examined in the manner required. The core question confronting us, as it was before the Division Bench, is whether the demand is by way of a tax/levy or simply in the nature of royalty for permission for advertising through hoardings within the limits of the Corporation. The Court, at this juncture, would clarify that there can be no issue with the proposition of law as stands settled by the various earlier decisions of this Court with regard to the power and modality of charging of tax/levy, which obviously has to be done in terms of the power conferred under/by authority by law. 23. In the present case, however, it cannot be lost sight of, as also elucidated in Indsil Hydro Power and Manganese Limited (supra), especially in Paragraph 56 thereof, after considering a host of precedents, that the imposition of royalty cannot be equated with imposition of tax/levy. Even otherwise, the law is no longer res integra that conduct of the parties and acquiescence would preclude a party from turning around and assailing a decision acquiesced to, except where there is an inherent lack of jurisdiction, or the exercise of authority is perverse or malafide, in law or in fact. In the instant factual setting, the advertising companies/respective Respondents No.1 had agreed in the year 2005 to pay a royalty of Re.1 per square foot to the Corporation for putting up hoardings/advertisements. We may note that only 2 advertising companies, in praesenti, moved the High Court by way of letters patent appeals, whereas, we are informed, a majority of the advertising companies complied with making payment(s) @ Rs.10 per square foot subsequent to the decision of the Corporation dated 02.11.2007. It is also worthwhile to note that the initial rate viz. Re.1 per square foot of royalty in the year 2005 was fixed after a Meeting with all the stakeholders on 29.08.2005. The advertising companies concerned had agreed to pay Re.1 per square foot royalty per year on such hoarding. The same was merely revised on 02.11.2007 i.e., after a period of over 2 years. 24. We have no hesitation to hold that such revision of rate was within the power of the Corporation. However, at this very stage, we are also [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1397 The Patna Municipal Corporation & Ors. v. M/s Tribro Ad Bureau & Ors. equally unhesitant to hold that the Resolution to charge enhanced royalty in exercise of purported power under Section 4316 of the Act was misplaced as royalty is not tax. It has been authoritatively clarified by this Court that royalty and tax are not one and same. As such, the Corporation's power to charge royalty cannot be interfered with on the ground that the same is not available, either in the Act or in the Regulations concerned, as there is no question of the said 'royalty' being a tax. Section 431 of the Act, therefore, would not come into the picture where royalty, that too by way of and under an agreement/ understanding is concerned. As stated previously, royalty and tax cannot be equated - the nomenclatures cannot be used interchangeably in law, both carrying starkly different imports and connotations. For reasons above, we are unable to maintain as tenable the argument that the demand made by the Corporation was a compulsory exaction. Equally, we are unable to state that the demand was/bore the hallmarks of a tax. The long and short of it is that 'Whatever be the nomenclature, the charges … in the present cases were for the privilege enjoyed …. … the basis for such charges was directly in terms of, and under the arrangement entered into between the parties, though, not referable to any statutory instrument. … For such benefit or privilege conferred upon them, the agreements arrived at between the parties contemplated payment of charges for such conferral of advantage. Such charges, in our view, were perfectly justified.'7 25. The decisions pressed into service by Respondent No.1, we are afraid, are of no aid to its case. As far as the 5-Judge Bench decision in Ghaswala (supra) is concerned, the question that arose for consideration therein was 'whether the Settlement Commission … constituted under Section 245-B of the Income Tax Act, 1961 … has the jurisdiction to reduce or waive the interest chargeable under Sections 234-A, 234-B and 234-C of the Act, while passing orders of settlement under Section 245-D(4) of the Act.' The Court, inter alia, reasoned that 'The Commission while exercising its quasi-judicial power of arriving at a settlement under Section 245-D cannot have the administrative power of issuing directions to other income tax 6 '431. Fine for not paying tax under Chapter XVII.- If any person erects, exhibits, fixes or retains any advertisement referred to in chapter XVII, without paying any tax under that chapter, he shall be punished with fine which - shall not be less than an amount equal to two times of such tax depending upon the gravity of the breach may extend up to an amount equal to five times the amount payable as such tax.' 7 Paragraph 57 of Indsil Hydro Power and Manganese Limited (supra). 1398 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports authorities. It is a normal rule of construction that when a statute vests certain power in an authority to be exercised in a particular manner then the said authority has to exercise it only in the manner provided in the statute itself.', and held that 'the Commission in exercise of its power under Sections 245-D(4) and (6) does not have the power to reduce or waive interest statutorily payable under Sections 234-A, 234-B and 234-C except to the extent of granting relief under the circulars issued by the Board under Section 119 of the Act.' Herein, the question is whether the demand was tax or royalty, and we have arrived at the conclusion that it is royalty, traceable to the arrangement/agreement between the parties, which makes Ghaswala (supra) inapplicable in the extant facts. 26. Punit Rai (supra), decided by three learned Judges, emanated from an Election Petition filed before the High Court. In his concurring opinion, learned S. B. Sinha, J., held 'If a customary law is to be given a go-by for any purpose whatsoever and particularly for the purpose of enlarging the scope of a notification issued by the President of India under clause (1) of Article 341 of the Constitution, the same must be done in terms of a statute and not otherwise.' and 'The High Court, therefore, erred insofar as it failed to consider that for the purpose of determination of caste, the respondent could not have relied upon the circular letter dated 3-3-1978 in absence of any law. …' Eventually, this Court took exception to the approach of the High Court therein and overturned its decision. The concurring opinion clearly lays down what could not have been done therein in the absence of a law. Again, for the same reason why Ghaswala (supra) is not relevant to the instant controversy, noted above, Punit Rai (supra) would not help Respondent No.1. 27. Naveen Jindal (supra) [rendered by the same coram as Punit Rai (supra)] held that the Flag Code was not a statute. It was also held that executive instructions, which the Flag Code was, were not 'law' within the meaning of Article 13 of the Constitution. This proposition is unassailable but does not carry Respondent No.1's case further in view of our findings and analysis. 28. Similarly, in Chandramohanan (supra), the Court [three-Judge Bench] placed reliance on Punit Rai (supra) and Naveen Jindal (supra) to conclude that Government Circulars issued by the State of Kerala were not 'law' within the ambit of Article 13 of the Constitution. This issue does not arise in the instant factual backdrop. [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1399 The Patna Municipal Corporation & Ors. v. M/s Tribro Ad Bureau & Ors. 29. The other aspect, which we would like to cover, is the proportionality/ reasonableness in the enhancement of the rate from Re.1 per square foot to Rs.10 per square foot. Whilst at first blush, the jump may seem high, being ten times, ultimately, it is subjective. Nothing has been canvassed before us to indicate that such rate was exorbitant or disproportionate, requiring judicial interdiction. There is no dispute that in the Meeting held on 29.08.2005, the advertising companies did not object to payment of royalty, as sought by the Corporation. Hence, a challenge could, later be mounted on limited grounds to the quantum/rate of royalty, and not on the decision to charge royalty itself. Even otherwise, as we do not find that the 'royalty' was a tax/ levy, the action of the Corporation cannot be struck down merely on the ground of having quoted Section 431 of the Act (wrongly), for, quoting the wrong provision of law, when the power to do an act otherwise exists, would not invalidate or render illegal the act in question. A Bench of three learned Judges in N Mani v. Sangeetha Theatre (2004) 12 SCC 278 held: '9. It is well settled that if an authority has a power under the law merely because while exercising that power the source of power is not specifically referred to or a reference is made to a wrong provision of law, that by itself does not vitiate the exercise of power so long as the power does exist and can be traced to a source available in law.' (emphasis supplied) 30. The decision in N Mani (supra) was relied upon by two learned Judges in Ram Sunder Ram v Union of India, 2007 (9) SCALE 197, wherein this Court reiterated that quoting the wrong provision of law, when the authority concerned is otherwise empowered to carry out an act, could not vitiate the act on such ground alone. Likewise, and on taking note of N Mani (supra) and Ram Sunder Ram (supra), 2 learned Judges in P K Palanisamy v N Arumugham (2009) 9 SCC 173 opined as under: '27. … Only because a wrong provision was mentioned by the appellant, the same, in our opinion, by itself would not be a ground to hold that the application was not maintainable or that the order passed thereon would be a nullity. It is a well-settled principle of law that mentioning 1400 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports of a wrong provision or non-mentioning of a provision does not invalidate an order if the court and/or statutory authority had the requisite jurisdiction therefor.' (emphasis supplied) 31. The above principle found acceptance also, inter alia, in Mohd. Shahabuddin v State of Bihar (2010) 4 SCC 653 and State of Haryana v Raj Kumar (2021) 9 SCC 292. 32. Respondent No.1 placed strong emphasis on the Patna Municipal Corporation (Grant of Permission for Display of Advertisements & Similar Devices) Regulations, 2012 dated 04.07.2012 and published in the Official Gazette on 13.08.2012. We find that this relates only to grant of permission for display of advertisements and similar devices in any place within the jurisdiction of the Corporation. However, it cannot be said that these Regulations would have conferred the right to demand royalty by the Corporation, which we find was traceable to the agreement/arrangement between the parties. 33. Once again, at the cost of repetition, as there has been no serious attempt to challenge the enhancement in quantum from Re.1 per square foot to Rs.10 per square foot, we refrain from delving into that aspect, which as of now has also become very old as it pertains to the year 2007. At this juncture, the Court would refer to the Written Submissions filed on behalf of Respondent No.1, where at Paragraph No.19, following is the stand: \"Without prejudice, to the preceding paragraphs and submissions, it is submitted that till no regulations are framed by the State Government, the respondent no.1 agrees to pay royalty to the Municipal Corporation at the enhanced rate of Rs.10 per sq. ft. per annum, prospectively. However, the same may be adjustable with the future demands ought to be raised by the Municipal Corporation after the Regulations under the Bihar Municipal Act, 2007, comes into effect.\" 34. To the above, we only observe that payment of enhanced rate of Rs.10 per square foot was not made retrospective by the Corporation, as it was made effective from November, 2007, i.e., 10 months after the resolution which was passed in January, 2007, and thus, we do not find any occasion to interfere in such demand from the date it\n\n[2024] 10 S.C.R. 1401 The Patna Municipal Corporation & Ors. v. M/s Tribro Ad Bureau & Ors. was made effective by the Corporation as there is no element of retrospectivity involved. 35. Yet, we hasten to add that future enhancement, if any, in the rate of royalty cannot be made to operate and/or have effect retrospectively. The same would have effect and operate only prospectively. 36. Accordingly, in view of the discussions hereinabove, the Court finds that the decision of the Corporation, to charge Rs.10 per square foot with regard to hoarding(s)/advertisement(s) as communicated at the relevant point of time to the concerned parties needs no interference. However, the imposition of penalty for non-payment needs to be interfered with as no such power exists. It is held thus, but with the clarificatory caveat that the Corporation would not be precluded from charging interest over delayed payment(s). Obviously, interest on delayed payment(s) would not be a 'penalty' but rather, in the realm of 'compensation' for late/delayed payment of amounts which were payable on/from an earlier date. This Court expressed a similar view in Alok Shanker Pandey v Union of India (2007) 3 SCC 545, as under: '9. It may be mentioned that there is misconception about interest. Interest is not a penalty or punishment at all, but it is the normal accretion on capital. For example if A had to pay B a certain amount, say 10 years ago, but he offers that amount to him today, then he has pocketed the interest on the principal amount. Had A paid that amount to B 10 years ago, B would have invested that amount somewhere and earned interest thereon, but instead of that A has kept that amount with himself and earned interest on it for this period. Hence, equity demands that A should not only pay back the principal amount but also the interest thereon to B.' (emphasis supplied) 37. In order to balance equities, the Court would indicate that the enhanced rate of Rs.10 per square foot would be payable by the respective Respondents No.1/advertising companies and other similarly-situated persons in terms of the Resolution of the Corporation from the date the same was made public/communicated to the concerned parties, whichever is later, with simple interest at the rate of 6% per annum. 1402 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports The Corporation is directed to furnish computation of amounts due to the parties concerned within 4 weeks. Payments be made within 16 weeks thereafter by the parties concerned, failing which they shall carry interest @ 10% per annum and be recoverable as arrears under the Bihar and Orissa Public Demands Recovery Act, 1914. Needless to state, amount(s), if any, paid over and above Re.1 per square foot, for the period in question, shall be adjusted towards the final liability to be determined by the Corporation vis-a-vis the respective Respondents No.1 herein and all other similarly-situated persons. 38. Parties shall bear their own costs. 39. Both appeals stand disposed of in terms aforesaid. POST-SCRIPT: 40. After we reserved judgment, a 9-Judge Bench of this Court in Mineral Area Development Authority v Steel Authority of India, 2024 SCC OnLine SC 1796, by a majority of 8:1, has held as under, fully supporting our view hereinabove: '126. There are major conceptual differences between royalty and a tax: (i) the proprietor charges royalty as a consideration for parting with the right to win minerals, while a tax is an imposition of a sovereign; (ii) royalty is paid in consideration of doing a particular action, that is, extracting minerals from the soil, while tax is generally levied with respect to a taxable event determined by law;8 and (iii) royalty generally flows from the lease deed as compared to tax which is imposed by authority of law. xxx 128. This Court has held that royalty is not a tax, in several decisions. In State of H P v. Gujarat Ambuja Cement Ltd,9 a three judge Bench of this Court held royalty not to be a tax. The subsequent decision in Indsil Hydro Power & Manganese Ltd. v. State of Kerala10 brought out the distinction between tax and royalty in the following terms: 8 Goodyear India Ltd. v State of Haryana (1990) 2 SCC 71 9 (2005) 6 SCC 499 10 Indsil Hydro Power and Manganese Limited (supra).\n\n[2024] 10 S.C.R. 1403 The Patna Municipal Corporation & Ors. v. M/s Tribro Ad Bureau & Ors. \"56. Thus, the expression \"royalty\" has consistently been construed to be compensation paid for rights and privileges enjoyed by the grantee and normally has its genesis in the agreement entered into between the grantor and the grantee. As against tax which is imposed under a statutory power without reference to any special benefit to the conferred on the payer of the tax, the royalty would be in terms of the agreement between the parties and normally has direct relationship with the benefit or privilege conferred upon the grantee.\" xxx 130. In view of the above discussion, we hold that both royalty and dead rent do not fulfil the characteristics of tax or impost. Accordingly, we conclude that the observation in India Cement (supra)11 to the effect that royalty is a tax is incorrect. xxx 342. … we answer the questions formulated in the reference in terms of the following conclusions: a. Royalty is not a tax. Royalty is a contractual consideration paid by the mining lessee to the lessor for enjoyment of mineral rights. The liability to pay royalty arises out of the contractual conditions of the mining lease. The payments made to the Government cannot be deemed to be a tax merely because the statute provides for their recovery as arrears;' (emphasis supplied) Result of the case: Appeals disposed of. †Headnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan 11 [1989] Suppl. 1 SCR 692 : (1990) 1 SCC 12.", "2024_10_1404_1447_EN": "[2024] 10 S.C.R. 1404 : 2024 INSC 791 Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India v.

[Para 33(c)] Airport Economic Regulatory Authority of India Act, 2008 - Whether AERA in exercise of its power under Section 13(1) (a) of the AERA Act is discharging an adjudicatory function: Held: (a) It cannot be concluded that AERA is performing an adjudicatory function merely because Section 13(1)(a) uses the phrase \"determine\" with respect to tariff - This would amount to a formalistic interpretation - The Court ought to make an assessment by undertaking a holistic analysis; (b) Section 13(1) (a) lays down seven factors which must be considered by AERA for determining the tariff of aeronautical services - It is settled that the function can be regarded as legislative even if objective guidelines are prescribed for the exercise of the function - Further, the provision only prescribes broad guidelines that AERA must \"take into consideration\" - AERA still has sufficient discretion to adapt to circumstances and various concerns while determining tariff - The Act does not prescribe the weightage that must be provided to each of the factors - That is well within the discretion of AERA - This is also evident from Section 13(1)(a)(viii) which provides that AERA may consider \"any other factor which may be relevant for the purposes of the Act\"; (c) The factors which are required to be considered by AERA indicate the underlying policy considerations of the assessment - The factors, inter alia, include the cost of efficiency and economic and viable operation of major airports; (d) Section 13(1A) requires that AERA be consulted regarding tariff and tariff structures which are proposed to be incorporated in bidding documents - This provision elucidates that even if AERA does not in a strict sense, \"determine\" tariff in terms of Section 13(1)(a), it will always be interested in the economic viability of airports and in that sense is a regulator of tariff - Thus, the considerations of AERA while determining tariff will be those of a regulator concerned with public and economic interests, which are purely non-adjudicatory considerations; (e) Section 13(2) 1406 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports by enabling AERA to amend the tariff structure even before the completion of the prescribed five year period in \"public interest\" is clearly indicative of its regulatory role in the regulatory sphere entrusted to it; (f) The \"overarching\" limitations placed on AERA's functions by Section 13(3) resemble the grounds for reasonable restrictions prescribed by Article 19 of the Constitution - These grounds are limitations on the broad policy considerations that AERA undertakes while determining tariffs - Thus, on analysis of the statutory provisions, it can be reasonably concluded that AERA is performing a regulatory function while determining tariff under Section 13(1)(a) of the AERA Act. [Para 58] Airport Economic Regulatory Authority of India Act, 2008 - Whether AERA is a necessary party in the appeal against its tariff order before TDSAT and whether it can be impleaded as a respondent: Held: When it comes to appeals against the tariff orders issued by AERA, it is not just acting as an 'expert body' but as a regulator interested in the outcome of the proceedings - AERA has a statutory duty to regulate tariff upon a consideration of multiple factors to ensure that airports are run in an economically viable manner without compromising on the interests of the public - This statutory role is evident, inter alia, from the factors that AERA must consider while determining tariff and the power to amend tariff from time to time in public interest as discussed above - When AERA determines the tariff for aeronautical services in terms of Section 13(1)(a) of the AERA Act, it is acting as a regulator and an interested party - It is interested not in a personal capacity - Its interest lies in ensuring that the concerns of public interest which animate the statute and the performance of its functions by AERA are duly preserved - Thus, AERA is a necessary party in the appeal against its tariff order before TDSAT and it must be impleaded as a respondent. [Para 63] Airport Economic Regulatory Authority of India Act, 2008 - s. 31 - Power of AERA to file an appeal against the order of TDSAT before this Court: Held: Section 31 does not expressly confer AERA with the right to file an appeal against the order of TDSAT before this Court - In fact, it does not confer that power to any party expressly - There are three ways in which provisions dealing with statutory appeal [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1407 Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India v. Delhi International Airport Ltd. & Ors. are drafted - First, the provision may not prescribe who can file an appeal such as Section 31 of the AERA Act - Second, the provision may provide that an appeal may be preferred by a 'person aggrieved' such as under the Electricity Act96, the Major Port Authorities Act 2021, the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act 1992 and the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority Act 2012 - The third category is where the statute confers 'any party' with the right to file an appeal as under the Companies Act 2013 - With respect to the first of the three categories, at a minimum the parties to the appeal before first appellate body (in this case TDSAT) will have a right to file an appeal before this Court - AERA can file an appeal under Section 31, it is a necessary party in the appeals against the tariff orders issued by it - The appeals filed by AERA against orders of TDSAT under Section 31 of the AERA Act are maintainable.

The respondents have raised a * Ed. Note: Pagination as per the original Judgment. 1 \"AERA\" 2 \"AERA Act\" 3 \"TDSAT\"\n\n[2024] 10 S.C.R. 1411 Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India v. Delhi International Airport Ltd. & Ors. preliminary objection to the maintainability of the appeals on the ground that AERA, which is a quasi-judicial body, cannot file an appeal against the judgment of TDSAT. This judgment disposes of the preliminary issue of whether the appeals filed by AERA under Section 31 of the AERA Act are maintainable. A. Statutory Background 2. The long title of the AERA Act provides that it is an Act to establish AERA and to a) regulate tariff and other charges for aeronautical services rendered at airports; (b) monitor performance standards of airports; and (c) for other incidental and connected matters.4 The Act applies to all airports where air transport services are operated or are intended to be operated, other than airports in the control of the Armed Forces or paramilitary forces of the Union.5 The Act also applies to all private and leased airports,6 all civil enclaves7 and all major airports.8 3. Section 3 of the AERA Act stipulates that the Central Government must, by a notification, establish AERA within three months from the date of commencement of the Act. By a notification dated 12 May 2009, the Central Government established AERA. Section 13 of the AERA Act prescribes the functions of AERA. AERA must perform the following functions in respect of major airports: a. Determine tariff for aeronautical services [Section 13(1)(a)]; b. Determine the amount of development fees [Section 13(1)(b)]; c. Determine the passengers service fee levied under Rule 88 of the Aircraft Rules 1937 notified under the Aircraft Act 1934 [Section 13(1)(c)]; d. Monitor the performance standards relating to quality, continuity and reliability of service as specified by the Central Government or any other authority authorised by it [Section 13(1)(d)]; 4 \"An Act to provide for the establishment of an Airports Economic Regulatory Authority to regulate tariff and other charges for the aeronautical services rendered at airports and to monitor performance standards of airports and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.\" 5 AERA Act; Section 1(3)(a) 6 AERA Act; Section 1(3)(b) 7 AERA Act; Section 1(3)(c) 8 AERA Act; Section 1(3)(d) 1412 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports e. Call for information necessary to determine the tariff [Section 13(1)(e)]; and f. Perform such other functions relating to tariff which may be entrusted to it by the Central Government or which may be necessary to carry out the provisions of the Act [Section 13(1)(f)]. 4. Section 13(1)(a) also prescribes the factors which AERA must take into consideration to \"determine\" tariff. The following are the seven factors provided by the provision: a. The capital expenditure incurred and timely investment in improvement of airport facilities; b. The service provided, its quality and other relevant factors; c. The cost of improving efficiency; d. Economic and viable operation of major airports; e. Revenue received from services other than aeronautical services; f. The concession offered by the Central Government in any agreement or memorandum of understanding or otherwise; and g. Any other factor which may be relevant for the purposes of this Act. The proviso to Section 13(1)(a) provides that different tariff structures may be determined for different airports, having regard to all or any of the considerations stipulated in the provision. 5. Section 13(2) provides that AERA must determine the tariff once in five years and may amend the tariff at any time within the five years in public interest.9 Section 13 (1A) provides that notwithstanding anything in Clauses (1) and (2) of Section 13, AERA will not determine the tariff or the structure of tariff or the development fees if it is incorporated in the bidding document which is the basis for award of operatorship.10 However, the proviso to Section 13(1A) requires AERA to be \"consulted\" in advance regarding the tariff or 9 13(2): \"The Authority shall determine the tariff once in every five years and may if so considered appropriate and in public interest, amend, from time to time during the said period of five years, the tariff so determined.\" 10 AERA Act; Section 13(1A)\n\n[2024] 10 S.C.R. 1413 Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India v. Delhi International Airport Ltd. & Ors. development fee which is proposed to be included in the bidding document and such fee is required to be notified in the Official Gazette.11 Section 13(3) provides that AERA is required to act in the interest of the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign states, public order, decency or morality while discharging its functions.12 Section 13(4) provides that AERA while discharging its functions must ensure transparency by, inter alia, (a) holding due consultations with all stake-holders with the airport; (b) allowing all stake-holders to make submissions before it; and (c) making all decisions of the Authority fully documented and explained. 6. Section 2(a) defines \"aeronautical service\" as the service provided for the following: a. For navigation, surveillance and supportive communication for air traffic management; b. For the landing, housing or parking of an aircraft or any other ground facility offered in connection with aircraft operations at an airport; c. For ground safety services at an airport; d. For ground handling services relating to aircraft, passengers and cargo at an airport; e. For the cargo facility at an airport; f. For supplying fuel to the aircraft at an airport; and g. For stake holder at an airport. 7. Section 14 confers AERA with the power to call for an information and conduct investigation regarding the activities of a service provider. The provision confers it with the power to do the following by an order in writing: a. Call upon the service provider to furnish in writing such information or explanation relating to its functions to access the performance of the service provider; b. Appoint persons to inquire into the affairs of a service provider; 11 AERA Act; proviso to Section 13(1A) 12 AERA Act; Section 13(3) 1414 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports c. Direct the inspection of book of accounts or other documents of any service provider; and d. Issue directions to monitor the performance of service providers. 8. The service provider is bound to produce all books of account and documents relating to the subject matter of the inquiry and furnish such statement or information. Section 15 confers AERA with the power to issue directions to service providers to discharge its functions under the Act.13 9. Section 17 provides that TDSAT established under the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India Act 1997 will be the Appellate Tribunal for the purposes of the AERA Act. TDSAT exercises original jurisdiction and appellate jurisdiction under the Act. Section 17(a) confers TDSAT with the original jurisdiction to adjudicate any dispute that arises between (a) service providers; or (b) service providers and consumers. The proviso to the Clause states that TDSAT can obtain the opinion of AERA on any matter relating the above disputes. Section 17(b) confers TDSAT with appellate jurisdiction over \"any direction, decision or order\" of AERA.14 13 \"15. Power of Authority to issue directions.- The Authority may, for the purpose of discharge of its functions under this Act, issue, from time to time to the service providers, such directions, as it may consider necessary.\" 14 \"Appellate Tribunal.- The Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal established under section 14 of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India Act, 1997 (24 of 1997) shall, on and from the commencement of Part XIV of Chapter VI of the Finance Act, 2017 (7 of 2017), be the Appellate Tribunal for the purposes of this Act and the said Appellate Tribunal shall exercise the jurisdiction, powers and authority conferred on it by or under this Act] to-- (a) adjudicate any dispute-- (i) between two or more service providers; (ii) between a service provider and a group of consumer: Provided that the Appellate Tribunal may, if considers appropriate, obtain the opinion of the Authority on any matter relating to such dispute: Provided further that nothing in this clause shall apply in respect of matters-- (i) relating to the monopolistic trade practice, restrictive trade practice and unfair trade practice which are subject to the jurisdiction of the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission established under sub-section (1) of section 5 of the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1969 (54 of 1969); (ii) relating to the complaint of an individual consumer maintainable before a Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum or a Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission or the National Consumer Redressal Commission established under section 9 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 (68 of 1986); (iii) Which are within the purview of the Competition Act, 2002 (12 of 2003); (iv) relating to an order of eviction which is appealable under section 28K of the Airports Authority of India Act, 1994 (55 of 1994). (b) hear and dispose of appeal against any direction, decision or order of the Authority under this Act. [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1415 Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India v. Delhi International Airport Ltd. & Ors. 10. Section 18 of the AERA Act deals with the procedure for settlement of disputes and appeals to the Appellate Tribunal. Sub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 18 provide that the Central Government, the State Government, a Local Authority or any person may make an application for adjudication of a dispute covered by Section 17(a) or prefer an appeal against the order of AERA. Section 18(4) stipulates that TDSAT must pass orders after giving the \"parties to the dispute or the appeal\" the opportunity of being heard. Section 18(5) provides that TDSAT must send a copy of the order to the parties to the dispute or the appeal and the Authority, \"as the case may be\": \"(5) The Appellate Tribunal shall send a copy of every order made by it to the parties to the dispute or the appeal and to the Authority, as the case may be.\" (emphasis supplied) 11. In terms of sub-section (6), TDSAT must endeavour to dispose the application or the appeal within ninety days of the receipt of it. It must record reasons in writing if it is unable to dispose the application within the specified period. Sub-section (7) provides that TDSAT may call for the records relevant to disposing the appeal or application.15 15 \"18. Application for settlement of disputes and appeals to Appellate Tribunal.--(1) The Central Government or a State Government or a local authority or any person may make an application to the Appellate Tribunal for adjudication of any dispute as referred to in clause (a) of section 17. (2) The Central Government or a State Government or a local authority or any person aggrieved by any direction, decision or order made by the Authority may prefer an appeal to the Appellate Tribunal. (3) Every appeal under sub-section (2) shall be preferred within a period of thirty days from the date on which a copy of the direction or order or decision made by the Authority is received by the Central Government or the State Government or the local authority or the aggrieved person and it shall be in such form, verified in such manner and be accompanied by such fee as may be prescribed: Provided that the Appellate Tribunal may entertain any appeal after the expiry of the said period of thirty days if it is satisfied that there was sufficient cause for not filing it within that period. (4) On receipt of an application under sub-section (1) or an appeal under sub-section (2), the Appellate Tribunal may, after giving the parties to the dispute or the appeal an opportunity of being heard, pass such orders thereon as it thinks fit. (5) The Appellate Tribunal shall send a copy of every order made by it to the parties to the dispute or the appeal and to the Authority, as the case may be. (6) The application made under sub-section (1) or the appeal preferred under sub-section (2) shall be dealt with by it as expeditiously as possible and endeavour shall be made by it to dispose of the application or appeal finally within ninety days from the date of receipt of application or appeal, as the case may be: Provided that where any such application or appeal could not be disposed of within the said period of ninety days, the Appellate Tribunal shall record its reasons in writing for not disposing of the application or appeal within that period. (7) The Appellate Tribunal may, for the purpose of examining the legality or propriety or correctness, of any dispute made in any application under sub-section (1), or of any direction or order or decision of the Authority referred to in the appeal preferred under sub-section (2), on its own motion or otherwise, call for the records relevant to disposing of such application or appeal and make such orders as it thinks fit.\" 1416 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 12. Section 31(1) provides that notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Civil Procedure 190816 or any other law, an appeal will lie against the order of the Tribunal to the Supreme Court on one or more of the grounds stipulated in Section 100 of CPC.17 B. Submissions 13. Mr K K Venugopal, Dr Abhishek Manu Singhvi, Mr Arvind Datar and Mr Prashanto Chandra Sen, Senior Counsel, and Ms Neelam Rathore, counsel appeared for the respondents. They submitted that the appeal filed by AERA is not maintainable for the following reasons: a. AERA which is a tariff fixing authority, cannot be an \"aggrieved party\" at any stage of the proceedings. Since it cannot file an appeal before TDSAT, it also cannot file an appeal before this Court under Section 31 of the Act assailing the order of TDSAT. Section 18(2) provides that \"any person\" aggrieved by any direction, decision or order made by the Authority may prefer an appeal to TDSAT. AERA will not be covered by the expression \"any person\" since that would amount to AERA challenging its own order; b. AERA cannot defend its own actions in the appeal against its order since tariff determination is a quasi-judicial function: i. Numerous judgments of this Court have held that tariff determination is a quasi-judicial exercise (see PTC India v. Central Electricity Regulatory Commission,18 BSES Rajdhani Power Limited v. Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission,19 Sitaram Sugar Co. Ltd v. Union of India20 and GRIDCO v. Western Electricity Supply Company of Orissa Limited21); ii. The procedure followed by AERA while fixing tariff elucidates that it is a quasi-judicial exercise. Section 13(4) 16 \"CPC\" 17 \"31. Appeal to Supreme Court.--(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) or in any other law, an appeal shall lie against any order, not being an interlocutory order, of the Appellate Tribunal to the Supreme Court on one or more of the grounds specified in section 100 of that Code.\" 18 [2010] 3 SCR 609 : (2010) 4 SCC 603 19 [2022] 14 SCR 790 : (2023) 4 SCC 788 20 [1990] 1 SCR 909 : (1990) 3 SCC 223 21 2023 SCC Online 1249\n\n[2024] 10 S.C.R. 1417 Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India v. Delhi International Airport Ltd. & Ors. requires AERA to follow principles of natural justice before determining the tariff of aeronautical services; c. The AERA Act does not expressly provide that AERA must be impleaded as a respondent to the appeal against its order before TDSAT; d. The interests of affected parties will be safeguarded even if AERA does not file an appeal against the order of TDSAT under Section 31. Section 18(2) permits any aggrieved person or even the Central Government who may act as a parens patriae to prefer an appeal against the order of AERA, and by extension the order of TDSAT; e. Section 31 does not expressly empower AERA to file an appeal against the order of TDSAT, unlike Section 53T of the Competition Act 200222 which empowers the Competition Commission to prefer an appeal before the Supreme Court against an order of the Appellate Tribunal; f. Section 18(5) provides that TDSAT must send a copy of all its orders to (a) parties to the dispute or appeal; and (b) the Authority. The provision by specifying the Authority separately from the parties to the dispute or appeal clarifies that it cannot be a party to the dispute or appeal, and consequently cannot prefer an appeal; and g. TDSAT or this Court may have to remand matters back to AERA for redetermination of tariff. AERA cannot be both a contesting party and also redetermine tariff. It would result in the possible operation of bias. 14. Mr Venkataramani, Attorney General for India and Mr Tushar Mehta, Solicitor General appearing for the Union Government, and Mr N Venkataraman, Additional Solicitor General appearing for AERA made the following submissions: a. An association representing the passengers may not necessarily prefer appeals in every case. While stakeholders may be allowed to make submissions before AERA in terms of Section 13(4), there is no statutory obligation on them to contest disputes 22 \"Competition Act\" 1418 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports or maintain appeals. AERA is concerned with the outcome of the decision by TDSAT on, inter alia, 'tariff determination' in its own interest as a regulatory body and in the interest of the general public; b. AERA will always be a contesting respondent when an appeal against its order or direction is filed before TDSAT. It will be covered by the expression \"parties to the appeal\" in Section 18(5). However, it will not be a party to the dispute. It is to cover such situations that the \"Authority\" has been separately referred. This is evident from the expression \"as the case may be\" in the provision; c. AERA is not a quasi-judicial authority. It is a regulator which performs multiple functions other than determination of tariff; d. Even assuming that AERA is a quasi-judicial authority, the embargo that applies to judicial authorities, that they cannot contest an appeal against their own orders, need not always apply to quasi-judicial authorities; e. A comparison cannot be made with Section 53T of the Competition Act. Section 53T identifies the parties that can file an appeal, as opposed to Section 31 of the AERA Act which only mandates that \"an appeal shall lie against any order, not being an interlocutory order of the Appellate Tribunal to the Supreme Court\"; and f. Institutional bias is not recognised in Indian jurisprudence. An institution or authority is independent of its officers who act under it. C. Issues 15. The following issues arise for the consideration of this Court: a. Whether AERA has a right to contest an appeal against its order determining tariff for aeronautical services before TDSAT, and then consequently prefer an appeal against the order of TDSAT before this Court under Section 31 of the AERA Act; and b. Even if AERA does not have a right to contest an appeal against its order determining tariff for aeronautical services before TDSAT, does it have a right to prefer an appeal against\n\n[2024] 10 S.C.R. 1419 Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India v. Delhi International Airport Ltd. & Ors. the order of TDSAT before this Court in terms of Section 31 of the AERA Act. D. Analysis i. Authorities exercising 'adjudicatory functions' cannot defend their orders in appeal 16. The respondents referred to judgments of this Court and of various High Courts for the proposition that statutory authorities exercising quasi-judicial functions cannot defend their orders in appeal. Before we proceed to determine if AERA is a quasi-judicial authority, it is necessary that we first clarify the contours of this proposition. 17. The judicial principle that a judicial or quasi-judicial authority must not be impleaded as a party to an appeal against its order is premised on two reasons, both rooted in constitutional philosophy. The first reason is that with the impleadment of the judicial or quasi-judicial authorities as respondents, they will be required to justifytheir decision before the Appellate Court. This is contrary to the established principle that Judges only speak through their judgments. Any dilution of this principle would lead to a situation where every judicial authority would be called upon to justify their decisions in the Court of appeal. This would break down the entire edifice of the judicial system. 18. In Savitri Devi v. District Jugde, Gorakhpur,23 a civil suit for maintenance was filed in the Court of the Munsif, Gorakhpur. The plaintiff filed a revision in the Court of the District Judge, Gorakhpur which was dismissed. The order of the District Judge was challenged in a writ petition before the High Court which was also dismissed. A Special Leave Petition was instituted assailing the order of the High Court. In the writ petition before the High Court and the Special Leave Petition before this Court, the District Judge, Gorakhpur and the 4th Additional Civil Judge (Junior Division) were impleaded as respondents and contesting respondents respectively. A three-Judge Bench of this Court deprecated the practice of impleading judicial officers who had disposed of \"the matter in a civil proceeding\": \"14. We do not approve of the course adopted by the petitioner which would cause unnecessary disturbance to 23 [1999] 1 SCR 725 : (1999) 2 SCC 577 1420 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the functions of the judicial officers concerned. They cannot be in any way equated to the officials of the Government. It is high time that the practice of impleading judicial officers disposing of civil proceedings as parties to writ petitions under Article 226 of the Constitution of India or special leave petitions under Article 136 of the Constitution of India was stopped. We are strongly deprecating such a practice.\" 19. In Md. Omer v. S Noorudin,24 an appeal was preferred against an order of the Registrar of Trade Marks before the High Court of Bombay. The Solicitor General of India put an appearance for the Registrar. The Solicitor General submitted that \"he appeared to help the Court by pointing out certain errors in the judgment of the lower Court.\" The Division Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay held that though there are certain cases in which the Registrar should appear, this was not one such case. Chief Justice Chagla, writing for the Division Bench observed that the Solicitor General made a startling proposition by which the Judge of the Court of first instance appears before the Court of second appeal to argue that his judgment was correct and the judgment of the Court of the first appeal was wrong. The Bench observed that: (a) there may be cases in which the Registrar could be a contesting respondent; and (b) the Registrar acting as a Court of first instance cannot appear before the second appellate Court \"merely\" to point the errors in the judgment of the Court of first appeal.25 20. The second reason for this principle is that the impleadment of the judicial authority as a respondent would contravene one of the 24 AIR 1952 Bom 165 25 \"14. […] I have never heard of a Judge of first instance briefing counsel in a Court of appeal in order to point out that the judgment of the lower appellate Court was wrong and his judgment was right. If this were the true principle, then every time we hear a second appeal we should look to being guided by the Judge of the trial Court appearing by counsel and telling us what the mistakes in the judgment of the lower Court are. We take it that this Court is sufficiently competent to find out for itself, with the guidance of the counsel of parties, as to what errors, if any, have been committed by the lower Court. We, therefore, think that it was entirely wrong on the part of the Registrar in this case to have appeared merely for the purpose of elucidating his own judgment and pointing out the errors in the judgment of the Court below. That is not the proper function of the Court of first instance, and in this case the Registrar is nothing else except the Court of first instance. […] But, as I said before, this Court neither needs illumination nor guidance from the Judge of the first instance as to what are the errors in the judgment of the lower appellate Court.\" [emphasis supplied]; Also see the judgments of the Delhi High Court in Union Public Service Commission v. Shiv Shambhu25 and SBI v. Mohd. Shahjahan25 in which the impleadment of the Competition Commission of India as a respondent in writ petitions filed challenging its orders was reprimanded. [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1421 Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India v. Delhi International Airport Ltd. & Ors. primary tenets of natural justice, that an adjudicating authority must not be biased. It is in deviation of the principle that an authority exercising adjudicatory functions is required to be a 'neutral arbitrator' which does not have a 'personal interest' in the matter. In Jindal Therma Power Company Ltd. v. Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation Ltd.,26 an appeal under Section 41 of the Karnataka Electricity Reforms Act 1999 was preferred before the High Court against the orders passed by the Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission by which the Power Purchase agreement between the appellant and the respondent was modified27. One of the issues before the High Court was whether the Electricity Regulatory Commission was either a necessary or a proper party to the appeal. The High Court held that the Electricity Regulatory Commission was neither a proper nor a necessary party in the appeal. The Court observed that an Authority must not take sides when an appeal is filed against its quasi-judicial order because if it exhibits an abnormal interest in the appeal \"normally unknown to statutory authorities performing quasi-judicial function\" it would give the impression that it is more of an \"affected party\".28 21. Hari Vishnu Kamath v. Syed Ahmad Ishaque29 was one of the first judgments in which this Court held that a Tribunal was not required to be impleaded as a respondent in an appeal against its order. In that judgment, a seven-Judge Bench of this Court heard an appeal against the decision of the High Court on a writ of certiorari for quashing the decision of the Election Tribunal. One of the issues before this Court was whether the High Court could not have issued a writ of certiorari because the Election Tribunal was an ad hoc body which became functus officio, having served its purpose,upon the pronouncement of the decision. It was contended that there would be no authority 26 2004 SCC OnLine Kar 204 27 \"Electricity Regulatory Commission\" 28 2004 SCC OnLine Kar 204 [31, 33] \"33. We also find considerable force in the contention of Dr. Singhvi that if ultimately this Court decides to remand the proceedings to the Commission for fresh consideration in exercise of its appellate jurisdiction, the Commission having contested the matter before this Court with abnormal interest and psyche of a private contesting litigant, cannot be fair enough to decide the issue with impartiality and disinterestedness required of it and that the confidence reposed by the appellant on the impartiality of the Commission will be lost. It is true if this Court in exercise of its appellate jurisdiction remands the proceedings to the Commission for reconsideration of evidence, there will be likelihood of the appellant entertaining apprehension that the Commission is not impartial in the decision making…\" 29 [1955] 1 SCR 1104 : (1954) 2 SCC 881 1422 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports against which the writ could be issued if the Tribunal had become functus officio. This Court rejected the argument and held that the fact that the Tribunal had become functus officio did not affect the jurisdiction of the Court to quash the order because the presence of the Election Tribunal, though proper, was not necessary.30 22. However, in Udit Narain Singh Malpaharia v. Additional Member Board of Revenue,31 a four-Judge Bench of this Court drew a fine line of distinction between an appeal against a decree and a writ of certiorari to quash the order of the Tribunal. Justice K Subba Rao (as the learned Chief justice then was), writing for the Bench observed that the Tribunal is a necessary party if a writ of certiorari is filed to quash its order because: (a) otherwise the order of quashing could be ignored; and (b) a writ of certiorari is filed to quash orders of the Tribunal which are outside their jurisdiction as opposed to a regular appeal where the Court decides if the order is erroneous.32 23. In Jogendrasinhji Vijaysinghji v. State of Gujarat,33 a two-Judge Bench of this Court culled out the following principles on the impleadment of Tribunals and Courts as parties in appeals against their orders after analysing the above three judgments. Justice Dipak Misra (as the learned Chief Justice then was) writing for the Bench made the following observations:34 a. Civil Courts are \"courts in the strictest sense of the term\". The Court and the judicial officer do not contest the order. The High Court in its revisional jurisdiction can call for the records (if 30 [1955] 1 SCR 1104 : (1954) 2 SCC 881 [13] 31 [1963] Supp. 1 SCR 676 : AIR 1963 SC 786 32 \"8. […] But there is an essential distinction between an appeal against a decree of a subordinate court and a writ of certiorari to quash the order of a tribunal or authority: in the former, the proceedings are regulated by the Code of Civil Procedure and the court making the order is directly subordinate to the appellate court and ordinarily acts within its bounds, though sometimes wrongly or even illegally, but in the case of the latter, a writ of certiorari is issued to quash the order of a tribunal which is ordinarily outside the appellate or revisional jurisdiction of the court and the order is set aside on the ground that the tribunal or the authority acted without or in excess of jurisdiction. If such a tribunal or authority is not made a party to the writ, it can easily ignore the order of the High Court quashing its order, for not being a party, it will not be liable to contempt. In these circumstances whoever else is a necessary party or not the authority or tribunal is certainly a necessary party to such a proceeding. In this case, the Board of Revenue and the Commissioner of Excise were rightly made parties in the writ petition.\" (emphasis supplied) 33 [2015] 6 SCR 504 : (2015) 9 SCC 1 34 [2015] 6 SCR 504 : (2015) 9 SCC 1 [41] [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1423 Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India v. Delhi International Airport Ltd. & Ors. required) without impleading the court or the presiding officer as a party; and b. Many Tribunals only adjudicate and have nothing to do with the \"lis\". Tribunals must be impleaded as a necessary party if in law they are entitled to defend the order passed by them. 24. It is clear from the above judgments that the principle that a judicial or quasi-judicial authority cannot be a respondent in the appeal is circumscribed by certain other factors. The first factor applied by this Court is based on the relief sought. A judicial or a quasi-judicial authority may be required to be impleaded as a party in a challenge against its order if it is necessary as in case of a writ of certiorari. Second, this Court has consistently drawn a distinction between Courts in the \"strictest sense\" and Tribunals because the former are nearly never involved in a 'lis' and perform a purely adjudicatory function. However, a statutory authority may be entrusted with the performance of both adjudicatory and regulatory functions. This Court has held that while it need not be impleaded as a respondent in an appeal against an adjudicatory order, it may be made a contesting party in an appeal against an order issued in exercise of its regulatory functions because then it may have a vital interest in the 'lis' bearing on matters of public interest. 25. However, it must be noted that the judgment in Jogendrasinhji Vijaysinghji (supra) also holds that a Tribunal is entitled to defend the order in the appeal only if it is provided by law. That leads us to the subsequent question of whether the statute establishing the Authority and conferring it with powers and functions must expressly stipulate that it must be impleaded as a respondent in an appeal or it can be inferred by necessary implication. ii. Necessary and proper parties in regulatory proceedings 26. In Syed Yakoob v. KS Radhakrishnan,35 the State Transport Authority36 constituted under the Motor Vehicles Act 1988 and the State Transport Appellate Tribunal37 were impleaded as respondents in the appeal against the judgment of the High Court. The High Court 35 [1964] 5 SCR 64 : 1963 SCC OnLine SC 24 36 \"STA\" 37 \"STAT\"\n\n1424 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports held that the STA and STAT had overlooked material considerations while issuing transport permits. The counsel who appeared for STA and STAT before this Court asked for costs. Rejecting the argument, Justice PB Gajendragadkar writing for the majority of the Constitution Bench, observed that though STA and STAT were proper and necessary parties in the proceedings, it is unusual for them to be represented by counsel unless allegations are made against them for which they need to respond because \"they are not interested in the merits of the dispute\": \"19. […] It may be that in such proceedings, the Authority and the Appellate Tribunal are proper and necessary parties, but unless allegations are made against them which need a reply from them, it is not usual for the authorities to be represented by lawyers in Court. In ordinary cases, their position is like that of court or other Tribunals against whose decisions writ proceedings are filed; they are not interested in the merits of the dispute in any sense, and so, their representation by lawyers in such proceedings is wholly unnecessary and even inappropriate.\" (emphasis supplied) 27. In State Transport Authority Tribunal and Regional Transport Authority, Meerut v. Mohd. Lucman Shariff,38 this Court refused to entertain an appeal filed by the Transport Authorities against the judgment of the High Court because they were not \"aggrieved parties\". In Bar Council of Maharashtra v. MV Dabholkar,39 the issue before a seven-Judge Bench of this Court was whether the State Bar Council was an 'aggrieved party' to maintain an appeal under Section 38 of the Advocates Act 1961.40 Section 38 provides that \"any aggrieved person\" may prefer an appeal before this Court against the order made by the Disciplinary Committee of the Bar Council of India. Chief Justice A N Ray, writing the opinion for the majority held that the State Bar Council was an aggrieved person for the following reasons: 38 C.A No. 878 of 1963 39 [1976] 1 SCR 306 : (1975) 2 SCC 702 40 \"Advocates Act\" [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1425 Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India v. Delhi International Airport Ltd. & Ors. a. Under the provisions of the Advocates Act, the State Bar Council may initiate disciplinary proceedings either on its own or upon the receipt of information. Thus, there was no 'lis' in the proceedings before the Disciplinary Committee like there is in a suit between parties;41 and b. The expression \"person aggrieved\" must be interpreted widely in terms of the purpose and the provisions of the enactment. The test to be applied to interpret the expression \"person aggrieved\" is whether \"a person has a genuine grievance because an order has been made which prejudicially affects his interests\".42 The interest need not be personal or pecuniary. The Advocates Act confers the Bar Council a statutory interest in the rights and privileges of the advocates and the purity and dignity of the profession.43 28. Justice Bhagwati, in his concurring opinion agreed with the conclusions in the opinion of Chief Justice Ray but diverged on the limited point of whether there was a 'lis' between the delinquent advocates and the Bar Council. The learned Judge distinguished between the executive functions (ensuring professional conduct of advocates) and adjudicatory functions of the Bar Council (acting through the Disciplinary Committee).44 Irrespective of the divergence on whether this dispute could be termed as a 'lis', it is clear that this Court was of the uniform view that a statutory authority can be impleaded as an interested party. 29. In Competition Commission of India v. Steel Authority of India,45 this Court has in detail dealt with the issue that concerns us. In that case, Jindal Steels and Powers invoked the provisions of Section 19 read with Section 26(1) of the Competition Act by providing information to allege that SAIL had abused its dominant position by entering into an exclusive supply agreement with Indian Railways. The Competition Commission of India rejected the application for extension of time by SAIL. It held that a prima facie case was made out against SAIL 41 [1976] 1 SCR 306 : (1975) 2 SCC 702 [25] 42 [1976] 1 SCR 306 : (1975) 2 SCC 702 [28] 43 [1976] 1 SCR 306 : (1975) 2 SCC 702 [29] 44 [1976] 1 SCR 306 : (1975) 2 SCC 702 [40] 45 [2010] 11 SCR 112 : (2010) 10 SCC 744\n\n1426 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports and directed the Director General to make an investigation. SAIL challenged the above order before the Competition Appellate Tribunal. The Commission filed an application for impleadment before the Competition Appellate Tribunal on the ground that it was a necessary and proper party. Emphasis was placed on Section 18 of the Competition Act to contend that the powers, functions and duties of the Commission required it to be impleaded as a party in the appeals filed before the Tribunal. The Tribunal dismissed the application for impleadment. An appeal was preferred against this order. This issue framed by this Court was : \"whether the Commission would be a necessary or at least a proper party in the proceedings before the Tribunal in an appeal preferred by a party\".46 A three-Judge Bench of this Court held that the Commission was a necessary party in cases where it initiated a suo moto inquiry and that it was a proper party in all other proceedings before the Competition Tribunal: \"31(3). The Commission, in cases where the inquiry has been initiated by the Commission suo moto, shall be a necessary party and in all other cases the Commission shall be a proper party in the proceedings before the Competition Tribunal. The presence of the Commission before the Tribunal would help in complete adjudication and effective and expeditious disposal of matters. Bring an expert body, its views would be of appropriate assistance to the Tribunal. Thus, the Commission in the proceedings before the Tribunal would be a necessary or a proper party, as the case may be.\" 30. While arriving at this conclusion, this Court relied on the following aspects: a. Section 53-S(3) of the Competition Act provides that the Commission may authorise one or more Chartered Accountants, Company Secretaries, Cost Accountants or legal practitioners to present the case of the Commission with respect to any appeal before the Appellate Tribunal.47 The Commission's legal right to 46 [2010] 11 SCR 112 : (2010) 10 SCC 744 [30.3] 47 The Competition Act 2002; Section 53S; Also see the Competition Commission of India (General) Regulations 2009; Regulation 51 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1427 Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India v. Delhi International Airport Ltd. & Ors. representation before the Appellate tribunal would be diluted if the Commission was absent;48 b. The Competition Commission can initiate suo moto proceedings in terms of Section 19 read with Section 26 of the Competition Act. Principles of fairness require that such a party be heard by the Tribunal before any orders \"adverse to it are passed\". Thus, the Competition Commission is a necessary party in cases where an appeal is preferred against orders or directions in proceedings initiated suo moto by it since it is a dominus litus in such proceedings;49 c. The Competition Commission is a proper party in other matters for the following reasons: i. The Commission is an expert body and discharges regulatory functions.50 The assistance rendered by the Commission would be useful for a complete and effective adjudication;51 and ii. Regulations 24 to 26 of the Competition Commission of India (General) Regulations 200952 define the powers of the Commission to join or substitute parties in proceedings, allow persons or enterprises to take part in proceedings and to strike out unnecessary parties. The 2009 Regulations stipulate that the person or enterprise to be impleaded must have a substantial interest in the outcome of the proceedings and/or that it must be necessary in public interest.53 This principle must be extended to the exercise of jurisdiction by the Tribunal. The Competition Commission has a substantial interest in the outcome of the proceedings in most cases as the judgments of the Tribunal: (i) will be binding on it; (ii) provide guidelines for determining various matters of larger public interest; and (iii) affect the economic policy of the country. 48 [2010] 11 SCR 112 : (2010) 10 SCC 744 [104] 49 [2010] 11 SCR 112 : (2010) 10 SCC 744 [105,112] 50 See Brahm Dutt v. Union of India, AIR 2005 SC 730 51 [2010] 11 SCR 112 : (2010) 10 SCC 744 [106] 52 \"2009 Regulation\" 53 The Competition Commission of India (General) Regulations 2009; Regulation 25(1) 1428 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 31. The Competition Act, unlike the AERA Act, expressly provides the statutory authority with the right to present its case before the Appellate Tribunal.54 Section 52T of the Competition Act also expressly grants the Competition Commission the right to file an appeal before this Court against an order of the Appellate Tribunal.55 The judgment of this Court in Competition Commission of India (supra), however, does not hinge only on the express stipulations in the Competition Act. This Court drew a functional analysis of the role of the Competition Commission. This Court by creating a distinction between proceedings initiated by the Competition Commission suo moto and others, in effect made a classification between matters in which the Commission is an \"interested party\" and the ones in which it would assist in \"effective adjudication\". When the Commission initiates proceedings suo motu, it is discharging its duty to: (a) eliminate practices having an adverse effect on competition; (b) promote and sustain competition; (c) protect the interests of consumers; and (d) ensure the freedom of trade by other participants in markets in India. Thus, when it initiates a suo moto proceeding, it is discharging its function as a party vitally interested in the elimination of anti-competitive practices. In appeals against the orders of the Commission in inquiries initiated otherwise (on receipt of information or on a reference made to it by the Central Government or a State Government or a statutory authority56), the representation of the Commission is seen as necessary for the effective adjudication in view of its expertise in the field. Thus, the Competition Commission of India (supra) lays down the clear proposition of law that a statutory authority can be impleaded as a respondent in an appeal against its order even if the statute does not provide for it. It can be read by necessary implication based on the role conferred upon the authority by the statute. 32. Order 1 Rule 10 of CPC grants the Court the power to strike out or add parties. The Rule provides that the Court may either with or 54 Competition Commission of India Act 2002; Section 53S(2) 55 \"53T. Appeal to Supreme Court.- The Central Government or any State Government or the Commission or any statutory authority or any local authority or any enterprise or any person aggrieved by any decision or order of the Appellate Tribunal may file an appeal to the Supreme Court within sixty days from the date of communication of the decision or order of the Appellate Tribunal to them: Provided that the Supreme Court may, if it is satisfied that the applicant was prevented by sufficient cause from filing the appeal within the said period, allow it to be filed after the expiry of the said period of sixty days.\" [emphasis supplied] 56 The Competition Act, 2002; Section 19(1) [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1429 Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India v. Delhi International Airport Ltd. & Ors. without the application of the party, add the name of the party who ought to have been joined or whose presence before the Court may be necessary for the Court to effectively adjudicate upon the questions involved in the suit.57 This Court has sufficiently dealt with proper and necessary parties referable to Order 1 Rule 10 of CPC. A necessary party is defined as someone who is indispensable to the suit and without whom the suit cannot effectively proceed. A proper party, on the other hand, is a party who has an interest in the adjudication of the suit though they may not be a person in whose favour or against whom a decree ought to be made.58 This Court has further held that a party would not become a necessary party merely because she has an interest in the correct solution of the question involved. She would be a necessary party only when she would be bound by the result of the action and has a direct or a legal interest in the proceeding.59 In view of the judgments of this Court in Competition Commission of India (supra) and Dabholkar (supra), a statutory authority would have a legal interest in appeals against orders made by it in discharge of its regulatory duty. 33. In view of the above discussion, the following principles emerge: a. An authority (either a judicial or quasi-judicial authority) must not be impleaded in an appeal against its order if the order was issued solely in exercise of its \"adjudicatory function\"; b. An authority must be impleaded as a respondent in the appeal against its order if it was issued in exercise of its regulatory role since the authority would have a vital interest in ensuring the protection of public interest; and c. An authority may be impleaded as a respondent in the appeal against its order where its presence is necessary for the effective 57 Order 1 Rule 10(2): \"Court may strike out or add parties.- The Court may at any stage of the proceedings, either upon or without the application of either party, and on such terms as may appear to the Court to be just, order that the name of any party improperly joined, whether as plaintiff or defendant, be struck out, and that the name of any person who ought to have been joined, whether as plaintiff or defendant, or whose presence before the Court may be necessary in order to enable the Court effectually and completely to adjudicate upon and settle all the questions involved in the suit, be added. 58 See Vidus Impex & Traders Ltd. v. Tosh Apartments Pvt. Ltd. (2012) 8 SCC 384; Thomson Press (India) Ltd. v. Nanak Builders & Investors P. Ltd. (2013) 5 SCC 397 59 See Ramesh Hirachand Kundanmal v. Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay (1992) 2 SCC 524(14); Also see Karthuri v. Uyyamperumal (2005) 6 SCC 733 1430 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports adjudication of the appeal in view of its domain expertise. iii. The test of quasi-judicial functions: A misnomer 34. The next issue is whether AERA is undertaking an adjudicatory function in determining tariff under Section 13(1)(a) of the AERA Act. We have already in the preceding section clarified that the test to be adopted is whether the authority was undertaking an adjudicatory exercise. However, before we proceed with this analysis, we deem it necessary to deal with the concept of 'quasi-judicial' functions since judgments of larger Benches have approached the issue of whether an authority can contest an appeal against its order based on whether it was issued in exercise of its quasi-judicial functions. 35. The respondents placed reliance on certain observations of the Constitution Bench of this Court in Express Newspaper Pvt. Ltd. v. Union of India60on the tests to be adopted to determine whether an administrative body is exercising a quasi-judicial function. One of the issues before this Court in that case was whether the functions performed by the Wage Board constituted under the Working Journalists (Conditions of Service) and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 1955 are administrative, judicial, quasi-judicial or legislative in character. This Court had to determine this question to decide if the decisions of the Wage Board were open to judicial view and whether the principle of audi alteram partem applied to the proceedings before the Wage Boards.61 The Constitution Bench laid down the following test to determine if an administrative body is exercising a quasi-judicial function: \"112. In order, therefore, to determine whether an administrative body is exercising a quasi-judicial function, it would be necessary to examine in the first instance, whether it has to decide on evidence between a proposal and an opposition and secondly, whether it under a duty to act judicially in the matter of arriving at its decision.\" 36. In the subsequent section, we will refer to the meaning of the phase \"quasi-judicial\" and its legal underpinnings. We will explain how the 60 1959 SCR 12 61 1959 SCR 12 [93] [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1431 Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India v. Delhi International Airport Ltd. & Ors. test of the duty to act 'judicially' was a standard that was evolved to ensure the compliance of the principles of natural justice and how it is no more relevant in view of the constitutionalising of the principles of natural justice. 37. In the 1950s, a functional distinction was drawn between executive and judicial62 actions and between an action that deprives rights and an action that deprives privileges63 for deciding the applicability of the principles of natural justice.64 It was presumed that only a judicial body must act 'judicially' by following the principles of natural justice. Numerous judgments of this Court (similar to the judgment in Express Newspaper (supra) discussed above) speak of the 'duty to act judicially'. To act 'judicially' meant to comply with the principles of natural justice. Courts began diluting the distinction between quasi-judicial and administrative actions to ensure that administrative actions or proceedings by authorities which are not Courts in a strict sense also comply with the principles of natural justice. The term \"quasi-judicial\" came into vogue to describe the exercise of power which though administrative in some respects was required to be exercised judicially, that is, in accordance with the principles of natural justice because of its impact on the rights of persons affected.65 38. In R v. ex p London Electricity Joint Committee Co. (1920) Ltd.,66 Lord Atkin laid down the following three components of a \"quasi- judicial order\": (a) there must be a legal authority; (b) the authority must determine questions affecting rights of subjects; and (c) the authority must have a duty to act judicially. This test has been applied by this Court in Province of Bombay v. Khushaldas S Advani,67 Shivji Nathubhai v. Union of India68 and Indian National Congress (I)69 to determine if a function is quasi-judicial. 62 The King v. Inspector of Leman Street Police Station, Ex Parte Venicoff (1920) 3 K.B. 72 63 Nakkuda Ali v. MF De S Jayaratne [1951] AC 66 64 id 65 Wade & Forsyth's Administrative Law (12th ed. Oxford University Press) 393 66 (1924) 1 KB 171 (CA) 67 [1950] SCR 621 68 [1960] 2 SCR. 775 : AIR 1960 SC 606 69 [2002] 3 SCR 1040 : (2002) 5 SCC 685 1432 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 39. In Khushaldas S Advani (supra), the issue before a four-Judge Bench of this Court was whether an order requisitioning a flat under Section 3 of the Bombay Land Requisition Ordinance70 was quasi- judicial. Section 3 of the Ordinance stipulated that the Provincial Government may by an order in writing requisition any land for a public purpose provided that it is necessary or expedient to do so. Sections 10 and 11 of the Ordinance stipulated that the Provincial Government may obtain information, enter and inspect land. One of the arguments was that a decision is quasi-judicial whenever there is a determination of a fact which affects the rights of parties.71 40. Chief Justice Harilal Kania held that the test to be applied to determine if a decision is quasi-judicial is if the law under which the authority is making a decision itself requires a quasi-judicial approach. The learned Chief Justice considered two factors in arriving at the conclusion that Section 3 of the Ordinance did not confer a quasi- judicial power: first, whether the opinion can be revised by another authority or whether it can only be challenged on the grounds on which legislative actions are challenged;72 and second, Sections 10 and 11 of the Ordinance which conferred the Provincial Government with the power to inspect and make inquires, were not mandatorily required to be followed. Justice Fazl Ali in his concurring opinion observed that an order will be quasi-judicial or judicial if issued by a person or an authority who is \"legally bound to or authorised to act as if he was a court or a Judge.\"73 The learned Judge further expanded that to act as a Judge or a Court included the following: (a) right to representation; and (b) inquiry, hearing and weighing of evidence. Justice SR Das in his concurring opinion, made a crucial observation. The learned Judge held that an action will be quasi- judicial even if there was no lis between two parties, provided the statutory authority has the power to do an act which will prejudicially affect the subject:74 \"81. In other words, while the presence of two parties besides the deciding authority will prima facie, and in the 70 \"Ordinance\" 71 [1950] SCR 621 [11] 72 [1950] SCR 621 [14] 73 [1950] SCR 621 [21] 74 [1950] SCR 621 [80.2]\n\n[2024] 10 S.C.R. 1433 Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India v. Delhi International Airport Ltd. & Ors. absence of any other factor impose upon the authority the duty to act judicially, the absence of two such parties is not decisive in taking the act of the authority out of the category of quasi-judicial act if the authority is nevertheless required by the statute to act judicially.\" 41. In Ridge v. Baldwin,75 Lord Reid observed that the judicial character of the duty must be inferred from the nature of the duty itself. Since the decision in Ridge (supra), Courts have inferred the duty to act judicially, that is, in compliance with the principles of natural justice based on whether the decision adversely affects legal rights. Over time, Courts have abandoned the classification between quasi- judicial and administrative functions because the duty to act fairly, in compliance with the principles of natural justice has been read into administrative actions as well.76 MP Jain and SN Jain in their treatise on Administrative law elucidate the reasons for the blurring of this distinction77: \"Differentiation between quasi-judicial and administrative seems to be merely an artificial formality, as many a time such a distinction is elusive and mostly a manner of judicial policy. Also, since the functions of the Administration have been expanding adversely affecting the rights and interests of individuals, the courts are convinced that it is essential to concede the right of hearing on a broader scale, but, at the same time, it may be artificial to call a function as quasi-judicial as it may have no judicial element involved. Or, in a situation, the court may feel that the function of the Administration is such that it is susceptible to the application of only a few but not all the elements of natural justice. […] Further, when a proceeding is characterised as administrative, the person whose interests are adversely affected thereby may be left with no effective means of redress of his grievances as he could claim no procedural safeguards. To overcome these difficulties, the new trend has emerged. The advantage is that procedural fairness 75 [1964] A.C 40 76 See In r HK (An Infant), (1967) 1 All ER 226 77 MP Jain & SN Jain, \"Principles of Administrative Law\" (7th ed. Vol I, LexisNexis) 352 1434 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports can be imposed on a large number of decision-making bodies without having to characterise their functions as quasi-judicial. This approach has resulted in applying hearing procedure to a large chunk of administrative process. The nexus between hearing and quasi-judicial no longer exists in administrative process. This approach does away with the conceptual approach of calling a function as quasi-judicial when not much of judicial element is discernible there. […] The emphasis is now placed on the element of injury to the concerned person by the administrative action in question to concede hearing to the affected person.\" (emphasis supplied) 42. In AK Kraipak v. Union of India,78 a Constitution Bench renounced the distinction between quasi-judicial and administrative functions for the purpose of a compliance of the principles of natural justice. Relying on the judgment of the Queen's Bench Division in In re H.K (An Infant)79 and the constitutional imperative of the rule of law,80 the Constitution Bench held that the principles of natural justice will apply even to administrative decisions.81 The judgment of the Constitution Bench in Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India82 has cemented this interpretation.83 78 [1970] 1 SCR 457 : (1969) 2 SCC 262 79 (1967) 2 QB 617; \"But at the same time, I myself think that even if an immigration officer is not in a judicial or a quasi-judicial capacity, he must at any rate give the immigrant an opportunity of satisfying him of the matters in the sub-section, and for that purpose let the immigrant know what his immediate impression is so that the immigrant can disabuse him.\" In this context, also see the observations of Lord Parker C.J., in Reginal v. Criminal Injuries Compensation Board Ex parte Lain (1967) 2 QB 684: \"With regard to Mr Bridge's second point, I cannot think that Atkin L.J., intended to confine his principle to cases in which the determination affected rights in the sense of enforceable rights. Indeed, in the Electricity Commissioners case the rights determined were at any rate not immediately enforceable rights. […] the remedy is available even though the decision is merely a step as a result of which legally enforceable rights may be affected.\" 80 [1970] 1 SCR 457 : (1969) 2 SCC 262 [13] 81 \"20. […] If the purpose of the rules of natural justice is to prevent miscarriage of justice one fails to see why those rules should be made inapplicable to administrative enquiries. Often times it is not easy to draw the line that demarcates administrative enquiries from quasi-judicial enquires. […] Arriving at a just decision I the aim of both quasi-judicial enquiries as well as administrative enquiries.\" [emphasis supplied] 82 [1978] 2 SCR 621 : AIR 1978 SC 597 83 \"The law must, therefore, now be taken to be well settled that even in an administrative proceeding, which involved civil consequences, the doctrine of natural justice must be held to be applicable.\" Also see SL Kapoor v. Jagmohan, AIR 1981 SC 136 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1435 Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India v. Delhi International Airport Ltd. & Ors. 43. The above discussion elucidates that the exercise of power by Authorities and Tribunals was described as \"quasi-judicial' to ensure that the principles of natural justice were complied with. However, with the evolution of the doctrine of fariness and reasonableness, all administrative actions (even if there is nothing 'judicial (or adjudicatory)' about them) are required to comply with the principles of natural justice. The evolution of the fairness doctrine has transcended many boundaries. Thus, the reason for which the expression 'quasi- judicial' came into vogue is no longer relevant. Neither are the tests to identify them because the functions of an authority no more need to have any semblance to 'judicial functions' for it to act judicially (that is, comply with the principles of natural justice). 44. The observations in judgments of this Court that a quasi-judicial authority must not be impleaded as a party in an appeal against its order must be interpreted in view of the doctrinal expansion of the principle of fairness. The substitution of the standard of whether the Authority undertakes a quasi-judicial function with the test of adjudication is thus, not an aberration. It is a standard which is true to the purpose of the principle and which accounts for the subsequent constitutional developments. iv. The test for determining an 'adjudicatory function': Exploring Sitaram Sugar 45. Before we proceed to determine if tariff-determination by AERA is an adjudicatory function, we must answer a more preliminary question: what are the tests to identify if a function is an adjudicatory one? 46. In Sitaram Sugar (supra), the constitutional validity of notifications issued under Section 3(3C) of the Essential Commodities Act 1995 was before a Constitution Bench of this Court. Section 3(3C) provides that where producers are required to sell sugar, they must be paid an amount calculated with reference to the price of sugar determined by the Central Government. The provision also lays down the factors which must be considered by the Central Government while determining the price of sugar.84 The provision further provides that 84 (a) the minimum price, if any, fixed for sugarcane by the Central Government under this section; (b) the manufacturing cost of sugar; (c) the duty or tax, if any, paid or payable thereon; (d) the securing of a reasonable return on the capital employed in the business of manufacturing sugar,\n\n1436 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports different prices may be determined from time to time for (a) different areas or; (b) for different factories; or (c) for different kinds of sugar. This Court distinguished between legislation and adjudication. The Constitution Bench held that the former affects the rights of individuals in an abstract manner while adjudication operates \"upon individuals in their individual capacity.\" 85 Relying on the following observations of this Court in Union of India v. Cynamide India Ltd.,86 the Bench held that price fixation is usually a legislative measure and that it may occasionally take an adjudicatory character when it relates to an individual: \"A price fixation measure does not concern itself with the interests of an individual manufacturer or producer. It is generally in relation to a particular commodity or class of commodities or transactions. It is a direction of a general character, not directed against a particular situation. It is intended to operate in the future. It is conceived in the interests of the general consumer public. Viewed from whatever angle, the angle of general application, the prospectiveness of its effect, the public interest served, and the rights and obligations flowing therefrom, there can be no question that price fixation is ordinarily a legislative activity.\" \"Price fixation may occasionally assume an administrative or quasi-judicial character when it relates to acquisition or requisition of goods or property from individuals and it becomes necessary to fix the price separately in relation to such individuals. Such situations may arise when the owner of property or goods is compelled to sell his property or goods to the government or its nominee and the price to be paid is directed by the legislature to be determined according to the statutory guidelines laid down by it. In such situations the determination of price may acquire a quasi-judicial character\" (emphasis supplied) 85 [1990] 1 SCR 909 : (1990) 3 SCC 223 [34] 86 [1987] 2 SCR 841 : (1987) 2 SCC 729 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1437 Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India v. Delhi International Airport Ltd. & Ors. 47. On the facts of the case, the Bench held that price fixation is of a legislative character but the amount determined based on the price is adjudicatory because the former applies generally to a class of commodities while the latter is decided after taking individual aspects into consideration. This Court also held that price fixation can be of a legislative character even if it is based on an objective criteria87. 88 48. Two principles are deducible from the judgment of this Court in Sitaram Sugar (supra). The first is that one of the factors to determine if an order was issued in exercise of an adjudicatory function, is whether it was specific to an individual or of general application. The second is that it is not necessary that a legislative action must always be 'subjective' and an adjudicatory function 'objective'. The Constitution Bench repudiated this distinction by observing that a legislative action can also be based on an objective set of factors. v. Whether tariff determination is an adjudicatory function: PTC and GRIDCO 49. In PTC (supra), a Constitution Bench of this Court made certain observations on the fixation of tariff by the Electricity Commission under the provisions of the Electricity Act 2003.89 Section 61 of the Electricity Act provides that the Appropriate Commission (which is defined under the Act to mean Central Regulatory Commission, State Regulatory Commission or Joint Commission) must, subject to the provisions of the Electricity Act, specify the terms and conditions for the determination of tariff. The provision also stipulates factors that the Appropriate Commission must be guided by. Section 62 deals with the \"determination of tariff\". The provision confers the Appropriate Commission with the power to determine tariff for supply, transmission, wheeling and retail sale of electricity. Section 63 87 [1990] 1 SCR 909 : (1990) 3 SCC 223 [41]; See Saraswati Industrial Syndicate Ltd. v. Union of India (1974) 2 SCC 630 88 \"41. The impugned orders, duly published in the official gazettes notifying the prices determined for sugar of various grades and produced in various zones, and applicable to all producers of such sugar, can, in our view, be legitimately characterised as legislative. These orders are required by sub-section (6) to be laid before both Houses of Parliament. The notified prices are applicable without exception to all persons falling within well defined groups. The prices are determined in accordance with the norms postulated in the sub-section. It is with reference to such predetermined prices of sugar that the \"amount\" payable to each producer, who has sold sugar in compliance with an order made with reference to clause (f) of sub-section (2), is calculated. The calculation of such amount is, in contradistinction to the determination of \"price of sugar\", a non-legislative act.\" 89 \"Electricity Act\" 1438 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports deals with \"determination of tariff by bidding process\". The provision provides that notwithstanding Section 62, the Appropriate Commission must adopt the tariff determined through a transparent bidding process. Section 64 of the Electricity Act prescribes the procedure to determine tariff under Section 62 which includes filing an application and provision for suggestions and objections. Referring to these provisions, the Constitution Bench made the following observations: \" 26. The term \"tariff\" is not defined in the 2003 Act. The term \"tariff\" includes within its ambit not only the fixation of rates but also the rules and regulations relating to it. If one reads Section 61 with Section 62 of the 2003 Act, it becomes clear that the appropriate Commission shall determine the actual tariff in accordance with the provisions of the Act, including the terms and conditions which may be specified by the appropriate Commission under Section 61 of the said Act. Under the 2003 Act, if one reads Section 62 with Section 64, it becomes clear that although tariff fixation like price fixation is legislative in character, the same under the Act is made appealable vide Section 111. These provisions, namely, Sections 61, 62 and 64 indicate the dual nature of functions performed by the Regulatory Commissions viz. decision-making and specifying terms and conditions for tariff determination. 49. On the above analysis of various sections of the 2003 Act, we find that the decision-making and regulation-making functions are both assigned to CERC. Law comes into existence not only through legislation but also by regulation and litigation. Laws from all three sources are binding. According to Professor Wade, \"between legislative and administrative functions we have regulatory functions\". A statutory instrument, such as a rule or regulation, emanates from the exercise of delegated legislative power which is a part of administrative process resembling enactment of law by the legislature whereas a quasi- judicial order comes from adjudication which is also a part of administrative process resembling a judicial decision by a court of law. (See Shri Sitaram Sugar Co. Ltd. v. Union of India [(1990) 3 SCC 223].)\n\n[2024] 10 S.C.R. 1439 Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India v. Delhi International Airport Ltd. & Ors. 50. Applying the above test, price fixation exercise is really legislative in character, unless by the terms of a particular statute it is made quasi-judicial as in the case of tariff fixation under Section 62 made appealable under Section 111 of the 2003 Act, though Section 61 is an enabling provision for the framing of regulations by CERC. If one takes \"tariff\" as a subject-matter, one finds that under Part VII of the 2003 Act actual determination/ fixation of tariff is done by the appropriate Commission under Section 62 whereas Section 61 is the enabling provision for framing of regulations containing generic propositions in accordance with which the appropriate Commission has to fix the tariff. This basic scheme equally applies to the subject-matter \"trading margin\" in a different statutory context as will be demonstrated by discussion hereinbelow.\" (emphasis supplied) 50. The observations of the Constitution Bench are analysed below: a. Tariff-fixation, like price fixation is generally of a legislative character; b. Tariff-fixation is of an adjudicatory or quasi-judicial character if it is made so by the statute which confers the Authority with the power to determine tariff; c. The Electricity Act confers the Appropriate Commission with both regulatory and adjudicatory/decision-making powers, even with respect to tariff. Section 61 which confers the Appropriate Commission with the power to specify terms and conditions for the determination of tariff, is of legislative character while the power to determine tariff in terms of Sections 62 and 64 is an adjudicatory function; d. Though the decision does not expressly make a distinction between powers that are general in nature and powers that are specific/individual in nature, such an inference can be drawn from paragraph 50 which specifically applies the tests formulated in Sitaram Sugar (supra); and e. The fact that the order of the Appropriate Commission determining tariff was subject to appeal was also one of the factors that weighed with this Court. 1440 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 51. The respondents have relied on PTC (supra) to contend that tariff determination by an Authority constituted under any statute is an adjudicatory function. Such an interpretation of the judgment in PTC (supra), in our opinion is erroneous. This Court in PTC (supra) expressly noted that tariff fixation, like price fixation is generally of a legislative character. The judgment in PTC (supra) is an authority only for the proposition that the question of whether determination of tariff is a legislative or an adjudicatory function must be determined upon an analysis of the provisions of the statute conferring the power. That was the test that was propounded in Sitaram Sugar (supra) as well. 52. In GRIDCO (supra), this Court was hearing appeals arising out of the decisions of the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity constituted under Section 110 of the Electricity Act 2003 which arose from orders issued by the Orissa Electricity Regulatory Commission determining tariff. Relying on the judgment in PTC (supra), a two-Judge Bench of this Court held that tariff determination being a quasi-judicial function, the Commission could not have preferred an appeal against the order of the Appellate Tribunal.90 The judgment of the two-Judge Bench in GRIDCO (supra) also dealt with the nature of function of the Appropriate Commission under Section 62 of the Electricity Act which was already settled by the judgment of the Constitution Bench in PTC (supra) that it was adjudicatory. vi. Tariff determination for aeronautical services by AERA is a regulatory function 53. The question that falls for our consideration is whether AERA in exercise of its power under Section 13(1)(a) of the AERA Act is discharging an adjudicatory function. The issue of whether AERA is a necessary or a proper party must be determined based on whether 90 \"31. There is one more aspect of the matter. As held by the Constitution Bench [PTC (India) Ltd. v. CERC (2010) 4 SCC 603], under Section 62, the Commission exercises quasi-judicial powers. There are appeals preferred by the Commission against the orders of the Appellate Tribunal in appeals under Section 111 of the Electricity Act. The Appellate Tribunal in appeals has dealt with the legality and validity of the decisions of the Commission rendered in the exercise of quasi-judicial power. In short, the Appellate Tribunal has tested the correctness of the orders of the Commission. The Commission is bound by the orders of the Appellate Tribunal. Therefore, we have serious doubt about the propriety and legality of the act of the Commission of preferring appeals against the orders of the Appellate Tribunal in appeal by which its own orders have been corrected. The Commission cannot be the aggrieved party except possibly in one appeal where the issue was about the non-compliance by the Commission of the orders of the Appellate Tribunal. If the Commission was exercising legislative functions, the position would have been different.\" [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1441 Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India v. Delhi International Airport Ltd. & Ors. the AERA is an aggrieved/interested party or merely an expert body whose views would be necessary for the effective adjudication of the appeal. 54. A simplistic conclusion that AERA regulates tariff and does not adjudicate it cannot be arrived at merely because the long title to the AERA Act states that AERA is established to, inter alia, \"regulate tariff\". An analysis of the statutory provisions must indicate the regulatory character of tariff determination by AERA. 55. Before we proceed to analyse the statutory provisions of the AERA Act, we deem it appropriate to refer to the reasons for creating an independent Airport Economic Regulatory Authority. On 30 November 2003, the Committee on a Road Map for the Civil Aviation Section published a report which highlighted the underlying economic rationale for establishing an Airport Economic Authority. The Report noted that an independent economic regulator must be established to prevent the abuse of monopoly power in airport activities. The Report further notes that the Airport Authority of India acts both as an operator and regulator of airports and thus, there is an inherent conflict of interest. It is to ensure that there was no such conflict of interest that an Independent Authority was sought to be established. 56. On 22 December 2009, AERA issued a White Paper to ensure transparency in the process leading up to the framing of appropriate procedures/systems for economic regulation. The White Paper dealt with various issues relating to economic regulation of airports and air navigation services. On 16 February 2010, AERA issued a consultation paper after considering the responses received on the White Paper. On 2 August 2010,91 AERA laid down \"its philosophy and approach for economic regulation of services\" at major airports. In exercise of its powers under Section 15 of the AERA Act, AERA issued the Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India (Terms and Conditions for Determination of Tariff for Services Provided for Cargo Facility, Ground Handling and Supply of Fuel to the Aircraft) Guidelines 2011.92 Clause 3 of the 2011 Guidelines lays down a three- stage procedure to regulate services by assessing (a) materiality; 91 Order No.05/2010-11 dated 1 August 2010 92 \"2011 Guidelines\"\n\n1442 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports (b) competition; and (c) the reasonableness of the existing user agreement.93 57. It may be argued by relying on the judgment in PTC (supra) that the 2011 Guidelines issued in exercise of the power under Section 15 is a regulatory function while the determination of tariff under Section 13(1)(a) is adjudicatory by relying on the distinction between 'general' and 'specific' as highlighted above. In PTC (supra), this Court drew a distinction between Section 61 of the Electricity Act which grants the Appropriate Commission the power to issue specific terms and conditions for determination of tariff and Section 62 which grants the power to determine tariff. The crucial test that has been consistently applied by this Court in drawing the distinction is to determine if the function is discharged in the capacity of a regulator or an adjudicator. Now, it may be possible that certain statutes create a clear distinction between the regulatory and adjudicatory roles with respect to the same function. When such a distinction is created, the Authority does not put on the hat of a regulator while undertaking the adjudicatory function. On the other hand, certain other statutes may require the Authority to 'determine' something in its capacity as a regulator. In such cases, a clear distinction between the adjudication and regulatory functions cannot be drawn. 58. On an analysis of the statutory provisions, it can be reasonably concluded that AERA is performing a regulatory function while determining tariff under Section 13(1)(a) of the AERA Act. The reasons for this conclusion are summarised below: a. It cannot be concluded that AERA is performing an adjudicatory function merely because Section 13(1)(a) uses the phrase \"determine\" with respect to tariff. This would amount to a formalistic interpretation. The Court ought to make an assessment by undertaking a holistic analysis; b. Section 13(1)(a) lays down seven factors which must be considered by AERA for determining the tariff of aeronautical services. To recall, the Constitution Bench in Sitaram Sugar (supra) has held that the function can be regarded as legislative even if objective guidelines are prescribed for the exercise 93 2011 Guidelines; Clause 3 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1443 Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India v. Delhi International Airport Ltd. & Ors. of the function. Further, the provision only prescribes broad guidelines that AERA must \"take into consideration\". AERA still has sufficient discretion to adapt to circumstances and various concerns while determining tariff. The Act does not prescribe the weightage that must be provided to each of the factors. That is well within the discretion of AERA. This is also evident from Section 13(1)(a)(viii) which provides that AERA may consider \"any other factor which may be relevant for the purposes of the Act\"; c. The factors which are required to be considered by AERA indicate the underlying policy considerations of the assessment.94 The factors, inter alia, include the cost of efficiency and economic and viable operation of major airports; d. Section 13(1A) requires that AERA be consulted regarding tariff and tariff structures which are proposed to be incorporated in bidding documents. This provision elucidates that even if AERA does not in a strict sense, \"determine\" tariff in terms of Section 13(1)(a), it will always be interested in the economic viability of airports and in that sense is a regulator of tariff. Thus, the considerations of AERA while determining tariff will be those of a regulator concerned with public and economic interests, which are purely non-adjudicatory considerations; e. Section 13(2) by enabling AERA to amend the tariff structure even before the completion of the prescribed five year period in \"public interest\" is clearly indicative of its regulatory role in the regulatory sphere entrusted to it; and f. The \"overarching\" limitations placed on AERA's functions by Section 13(3) resemble the grounds for reasonable restrictions prescribed by Article 19 of the Constitution. These grounds are limitations on the broad policy considerations that AERA undertakes while determining tariffs. 59. The respondents have relied on two clauses of Section 13 to argue that tariff determination is an adjudicatory function. The first is the proviso to Section 13(1)(a) which provides that different 94 See Express Newspaper (Private) Ltd. v. Union of India, 1958 SCC OnLine SC 23 [111]\n\n1444 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports tariff structures may be determined for different airports. This, it is argued, is a specific/individualistic component which is an indicator of the adjudicatory function. It is true that this Court in Sitaram Sugar (supra) held that one of the factors to assess if a function is adjudicatory is by determining if it has a specific or a general application. However, the observations cannot be interpreted to mean that it is an overarching consideration in the determination of whether the function is adjudicatory. Neither can it be interpreted to mean that the factor must be considered de hors the context. The consideration of the factors while exercising the function is equally and if not more important as a factor. As the judgment in Sitaram Sugar (supra) notes, \"judicial decisions are made according to law while administrative decisions emanate from administrative policy.\"95 As held above, the factors to be considered by AERA in terms of Section 13(1)(a) are purely 'policy' factors. Further, the function of AERA to determine tariff must be read in the context of the role of the Authority as a 'regulator' as has been highlighted above. Modern constitutional governance requires that legislation is not general but context specific. Over-emphasising the distinction between general and specific provisions to determine if a function is regulatory or adjudicatory would be to completely ignore the jurisprudential developments governing both the regulatory domain and Article 14. 60. The second provision that the respondents relied on was Section 13(4) of the AERA Act which requires AERA to follow certain principles of natural justice to ensure transparency in discharging its functions. There is no doubt that Section 13(4) incorporates some of the principles of natural justice. It requires holding consultations and allowing stakeholders to make submissions, and reasoned decisions to obviate the influence of bias in them. However, as explained above, that in itself is not sufficient to conclude that the AERA's determination of tariffs for aeronautical services is an adjudicatory function. In the previous section, we have in detail explained that principles of natural justice are not just a requirement for 'judicial' actions. They are required to be complied with even in the exercise of administrative actions. Thus, the requirement of the principles of natural justice does not render the determination, an adjudication. 95 [1990] 1 SCR 909 : (1990) 3 SCC 223 [32] [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1445 Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India v. Delhi International Airport Ltd. & Ors. vii. Interpretation of Sections 18 and 31 of the AERA Act 61. The respondents made the following submissions based on Section 18 to argue that AERA cannot be impleaded as a party to the proceedings before TDSAT: a. Section 18 of the AERA Act does not expressly provide that TDSAT must hear AERA before passing any order. Clause (4) of Section 18 provides that TDSAT may pass an order \"after giving the parties to the dispute or appeal\" an opportunity of being heard; and b. Section 18(5) expressly excludes AERA as a party in the appeal before TDSAT because it provides that a copy of every order of TDSAT must be provided \"to the parties to the dispute or appeal and to the Authority, as the case may be\". There is disagreement over whether the expression \"as the case may be\" takes after \"dispute or appeal\" or \"Authority\". If the expression takes after the former, it means that Authority is not subsumed within \"parties to dispute or appeal\". If the expression takes after the latter, it could mean that a copy of the order must be given to AERA if it is not a party to the dispute or the appeal. 62. We have already, in the previous section of this judgment after an analysis of the precedent, concluded that the Authority can be impleaded as a respondent in an appeal against its order even if the provisions of the statute do not provide for it. This power can be read by necessary implication based on the role conferred on the Authority by the statute. To recall, Section 17(1)(a) grants TDSAT the jurisdiction to adjudicate any dispute between two parties, either between two service providers or a service provider or a consumer. There is clearly a lis before TDSAT in such cases. However, the proviso to the section recognises the expertise of AERA in the economic regulation of airports by providing TDSAT with the discretion to \"obtain the opinion of the Authority on any matter relating to the dispute\". This is referable to the role of AERA as a proper party in the proceedings, where its expertise may be required for the effective adjudication of the dispute. 63. However, when it comes to appeals against the tariff orders issued by AERA, it is not just acting as an 'expert body' but as a regulator interested in the outcome of the proceedings. AERA has a statutory 1446 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports duty to regulate tariff upon a consideration of multiple factors to ensure that airports are run in an economically viable manner without compromising on the interests of the public. This statutory role is evident, inter alia, from the factors that AERA must consider while determining tariff and the power to amend tariff from time to time in public interest as discussed above. When AERA determines the tariff for aeronautical services in terms of Section 13(1)(a) of the AERA Act, it is acting as a regulator and an interested party. It is interested not in a personal capacity. Its interest lies in ensuring that the concerns of public interest which animate the statute and the performance of its functions by AERA are duly preserved. Thus, AERA is a necessary party in the appeal against its tariff order before TDSAT and it must be impleaded as a respondent. 64. Section 18(5) refers to parties in a dispute or appeal. AERA is not a party to the lis when TDSAT adjudicates a dispute between two or more service providers, or a service provider and a consumer in terms of Section 17(1)(a). For disputes adjudicated by TDSAT under Section 17(a), AERA may be included as a party in terms of the proviso to the provision. If the expression \"as the case may be\" is interpreted to refer to \"dispute or appeal\", thereby excluding AERA as a party to either the dispute or the appeal, it would amount to reading down the proviso to Section 17(1)(a). 65. It may be recalled that determination of tariff for aeronautical services is merely one of the functions discharged by AERA. Section 17(1) (b) grants TDSAT the jurisdiction to \"hear and dispose of appeal against any direction, decision or order of the Authority under this Act.\" Section 18(5) by using the expression \"as the case may be\" accounts for such a situation and requires that a copy of the order to be provided to AERA even if it is not a party to the appeal. Thus, the expression \"as the case may be\" in Section 18(5) must be read to mean that a copy of the order of TDSAT must be given to AERA even if it is not a party to the appeal or the dispute. The expression cannot be interpreted to impliedly exclude AERA as a respondent in the appeals against its orders before TDSAT. 66. Section 31 does not expressly confer AERA with the right to file an appeal against the order of TDSAT before this Court. In fact, it does not confer that power to any party expressly. As Mr Datar put it, there are three ways in which provisions dealing with statutory appeal are\n\n[2024] 10 S.C.R. 1447 Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India v. Delhi International Airport Ltd. & Ors. drafted. First, the provision may not prescribe who can file an appeal such as Section 31 of the AERA Act. Second, the provision may provide that an appeal may be preferred by a 'person aggrieved' such as under the Electricity Act,96 the Major Port Authorities Act 2021,97 the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act 199298 and the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority Act 2012.99 The third category is where the statute confers 'any party' with the right to file an appeal as under the Companies Act 2013.100 With respect to the first of the three categories, at a minimum the parties to the appeal before first appellate body (in this case TDSAT) will have a right to file an appeal before this Court. AERA can file an appeal under Section 31 in view of our conclusion that it is a necessary party in the appeals against the tariff orders issued by it. E. Conclusion 67. In view of the discussion above, the appeals filed by AERA against orders of TDSAT under Section 31 of the AERA Act are maintainable. The Registry shall list the matters before the Regular Bench for adjudication of the appeals on merits.

State of Gujarat & Ors. (Criminal Appeal No. 4307 of 2024) 21 October 2024 [Abhay S. Oka* and Augustine George Masih, JJ.] Issue for Consideration The appellant was convicted for offences punishable under Section 302 read with sections 147 and 148 Penal Code, 1860 and sentenced to life imprisonment. His application for remission was considered expeditiously by the State Government after interference of the Supreme Court. The State Government while granting remission imposed four conditions on the appellant. The appellant contended that two out of these four conditions are vague, subjective and arbitrary. The issue before the Hon'ble Supreme Court is the legality of these two conditions imposed by the appropriate government in exercise of its powers under Section 432(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short, 'the CrPC') while remitting the life sentence of the appellant. Headnotes† Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 - s.432(1) - Explained: Held: The appropriate government has the power to remit the whole or any part of the punishment of a convict unconditionally or subject to certain conditions - Actual remission takes effect only after the convict accepts the conditions - There is an identical provision in the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 (BNSS) in form of section 473(1).

Ms. Swati Ghildiyal, Ms. Devyani Bhatt, Ms. Shreya Jain, Advs. for the Respondents.\n\n[2024] 10 S.C.R. 1451 Mafabhai Motibhai Sagar v. State of Gujarat & Ors. Judgment / Order of the Supreme Court Judgment Abhay S. Oka, J. 1. Leave granted. 2. The issue involved in this appeal is as regards the legality of the conditions imposed while remitting the life sentence of the appellant in the exercise of powers under sub-section (1) of Section 432 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short, 'the CrPC'). There is an identical provision in the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 (for short, 'the BNSS') in the form of sub-section (1) of Section 473. FACTUAL ASPECTS 3. The appellant was convicted for the offence punishable under Section 302 read with Sections 147 and 148 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (for short, 'the IPC') and was sentenced on 18th February 2008 to undergo life imprisonment. The conviction of the appellant has attained finality. 4. The present appeal arises out of an order passed by the High Court of Gujarat on an application made by the appellant for grant of parole under Rule 19 of the Prisons (Bombay Furlough and Parole) Rules, 1959. As the prayer was rejected by the impugned order, this appeal was filed before this Court. While arguing the appeal before this Court, on 26th June 2023, a submission was made on behalf of the appellant that the application for remission made by the appellant under sub-section (2) of Section 432 of the CrPC was not being considered by the State Government. Therefore, a notice was issued on 26th June 2023 on that limited aspect, and a direction was issued to expeditiously decide the pending application for grant of remission. 5. On 15th September 2023, the Home Department of the Government of Gujarat passed an order granting remission to the appellant. His remaining sentence was remitted. While granting remission by the order dated 15th September 2023, four conditions were imposed, which read thus: 1452 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports \"Conditions: (1) After the release from jail the prisoner shall behave decently for 2 (Two) years. For this purpose he has to submit two Sureties of the respectable persons of the Society stating that the prisoner shall not breach the peace and harmony of the society and also shall not threaten the complainant and witnesses. (2) If the prisoner after the release from the jail carries out any cognizable offence or inflict any serious injury to any citizen or property then he will be arrested again and he will have to serve the remaining period of sentence in jail. (3) After being released from jail the prisoner shall mark his presence in the nearest police station for a period of 1 (one) year. (4) The prisoner shall be released only after paying the unpaid fine amount if any.\" (emphasis added) As the appellant was aggrieved by the first two conditions, we permitted him to amend the appeal and challenge conditions nos.1 and 2 instead of driving him to file a fresh writ petition before the High Court. SUBMISSIONS 6. Mr Rauf Rahim, the learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant, has made submissions on the power of the State Government to impose conditions while granting remission. He submits that the impugned conditions defeat the very object of the grant of remission. He submitted that the word \"decently\" used in condition no.1 is vague. The concept of decency differs from person to person. Therefore, putting such a condition of maintaining decent behaviour is completely violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India being manifestly arbitrary. It is submitted that putting such a condition confers arbitrary power on the State Government to cancel the remission order. Hence, the condition violates Article 21 of the Constitution of India.\n\n[2024] 10 S.C.R. 1453 Mafabhai Motibhai Sagar v. State of Gujarat & Ors. 7. Regarding condition no.2, the learned senior counsel submitted that even if a false allegation is made against the appellant of commission of any cognizable offence, he will be deprived of remission granted under the order dated 15th September 2023. The learned senior counsel relied upon a decision of this Court in the case of Shaikh Abdul Azees v. State of Karnataka.1 While dealing with sub-section (3) of Section 401 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (for short, 'the CrPC of 1898') which is pari materia with Section 432 of the CrPC, this Court held that on breach of any of the conditions on which remission is granted, there is no automatic revival of the sentence. He submitted that both conditions are completely illegal. 8. Ms Swati Ghildiyal, the learned counsel appearing for the 1st respondent-State of Gujarat, submitted that under sub-section (1) of Section 432 of the CrPC, the appropriate Government has the power to remit the whole or any part of the punishment subject to certain conditions. The provision requires the convict to accept the said conditions, without which he cannot be granted the benefit of remission. The learned counsel submitted that it is very well settled that a convict is not entitled to remission of the sentence as a matter of right. She submitted that the limited right of the convict is only to be considered for remission as held by this Court in the case of Union of India v. V. Sriharan alias Murugan & Ors.2 The learned counsel also relied upon a decision of this Court in the case of Epuru Sudhakar & Anr. v. Govt. of A.P. & Ors.,3 which lays down that the power to remit sentence is a discretionary power which has to be exercised on public interest considerations. The learned counsel submitted that the appellant has accepted the conditions imposed on him and has furnished surety in terms of condition no.1. Hence, no interference is called for. CONSIDERATION OF SUBMISSIONS 9. Section 432 of the CrPC reads thus: \"432. Power to suspend or remit sentences.--(1) When any person has been sentenced to punishment for an 1 [1977] 3 SCR 393 : (1977) 2 SCC 485 2 [2015] 14 SCR 613 : (2016) 7 SCC 1 3 [2006] Supp. 7 SCR 81 : (2006) 8 SCC 161 1454 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports offence, the appropriate Government may, at any time, without conditions or upon any conditions which the person sentenced accepts, suspend the execution of his sentence or remit the whole or any part of the punishment to which he has been sentenced. (2) Whenever an application is made to the appropriate Government for the suspension or remission of a sentence, the appropriate Government may require the presiding Judge of the Court before or by which the conviction was had or confirmed, to state his opinion as to whether the application should be granted or refused, together with his reasons for such opinion and also to forward with the statement of such opinion a certified copy of the record of the trial or of such record thereof as exists. (3) If any condition on which a sentence has been suspended or remitted is, in the opinion of the appropriate Government, not fulfilled, the appropriate Government may cancel the suspension or remission, and thereupon the person in whose favour the sentence has been suspended or remitted may, if at large, be arrested by any police officer, without warrant and remanded to undergo the unexpired portion of the sentence. (4) The condition on which a sentence is suspended or remitted under this section may be one to be fulfilled by the person in whose favour the sentence is suspended or remitted, or one independent of his will. (5) The appropriate Government may, by general rules or special orders, give directions as to the suspension of sentences and the conditions on which petitions should be presented and dealt with: Provided that in the case of any sentence (other than a sentence of fine) passed on a male person above the age of eighteen years, no such petition by the person sentenced or by any other person on his behalf shall be entertained, unless the person sentenced is in jail, and--\n\n[2024] 10 S.C.R. 1455 Mafabhai Motibhai Sagar v. State of Gujarat & Ors. (a) where such petition is made by the person sentenced, it is presented through the officer in charge of the jail; or (b) where such petition is made by any other person, it contains a declaration that the person sentenced is in jail. (6) The provisions of the above sub-sections shall also apply to any order passed by a Criminal Court under any section of this Code or of any other law which restricts the liberty of any person or imposes any liability upon him or his property. (7) In this section and in Section 433, the expression \"appropriate Government\" means,-- (a) in cases where the sentence is for an offence against, or the order referred to in sub-section (6) is passed under, any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends, the Central Government; (b) in other cases, the Government of the State within which the offender is sentenced or the said order is passed.\" (emphasis added) Under sub-section (1) of Section 432 of the CrPC, the appropriate Government has the power to remit the whole or any part of the punishment of a convict. The remission can be granted either unconditionally or subject to certain conditions. As expressly provided under sub-section (1) of Section 432, actual remission takes effect only after the convict accepts the conditions. Thus, there is no doubt that there exists a power in the appropriate Government to grant remission subject to compliance with conditions. 10. Insofar as the exercise of power under sub-section (1) of Section 432 of the CrPC is concerned, the Constitution Bench in the case of V. Sriharan2 has approved the view taken by this Court in the case of Mohinder Singh v. State of Punjab.4 The view taken is that the 4 (2013) 3 SCC 294 1456 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports decision to grant remission has to be well-informed, reasonable and fair to all concerned. 11. It is no doubt true that the power to remit a sentence under Section 432(1) of the CrPC is discretionary. One of the considerations for the exercise of the discretion can be public interest. The gravity and nature of the offences committed by the convict are also factors to be considered. The antecedents of the convict are also relevant. Almost all the States have a written policy on the grant of remission under Section 432(1) of the CrPC. For example, the 1st respondent, the State of Gujarat, has a policy that forms part of the Government Resolution dated 23rd January 2014, which was amended from time to time. The said Government Resolution incorporates guidelines/ policy for consideration of cases for grant of remission and premature release of prisoners. The existence of a rational policy is necessary to prevent the arbitrary exercise of power to grant a remission under Section 432(1) of the CrPC. 12. A convict cannot seek remission as a matter of right. However, he has a right to say that his case for the grant of remission ought to be considered in accordance with the law. The power under sub-section (1) of Section 432 of the CrPC has to be exercised in a fair and reasonable manner. Therefore, conditions imposed while exercising the power under sub-section (1) of Section 432 must be reasonable. The conditions must stand the test of scrutiny of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. If the conditions imposed are arbitrary, the conditions will stand vitiated due to violation of Article 14. Such arbitrary conditions may also violate the convict's rights under Article 21 of the Constitution. 13. Now, we come to condition no.1. The first part of this condition requires the convict to behave decently for a period of two years after release from jail. The convict must submit two respectable sureties to ensure that he does not commit the breach of peace and harmony of the society and does not threaten the complainant and the witnesses. The words 'decent' or 'decently' are not defined in the CrPC or any other cognate legislation. The concept of decency of each human being is likely to be different. The idea of decency keeps on changing with time. As the term 'decency' is not defined in the CrPC or any other cognate legislation, every person or authority may interpret the same differently. Therefore, such a condition while granting remission becomes too [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1457 Mafabhai Motibhai Sagar v. State of Gujarat & Ors. subjective. Putting such a vague condition while exercising the power under sub-section (1) of Section 432 of the CrPC will give a tool in the hands of the executive to cancel the remission at its whims and fancies. Therefore, such a condition is arbitrary and will be hit by Article 14 of the Constitution of India. Such a condition cannot be imposed as it will defeat the very object of remitting the sentence in the exercise of powers under sub-section (1) of Section 432 of the CrPC. Therefore, condition no.1 cannot be sustained. If a condition imposed is unclear or ambiguous, it can have different meanings. Consequently, it becomes very difficult to enforce such conditions. Thus, the condition imposed while granting remission must be such that it is capable of being complied with and enforced. 14. Now, we come to condition no.2, which provides that if the appellant, after his release from jail, commits any cognizable offence or inflicts any serious injury to any citizen or property, he will be arrested again and will have to serve the remaining period of the sentence in jail. Thus, this condition authorises the appropriate Government to arrest the convict and revoke the benefit of remission. This clause provides for automatic cancellation of the order remitting the sentence. In this respect, it is necessary to consider the decision of this Court in the case of Shaikh Abdul Azees1. It was a case where remission was earned by the appellant therein after undergoing a life sentence for fifteen and a half years. The High Court held that Section 303 of the IPC was applicable, and this was a case of conditional remission under Section 401 of the CrPC of 1898. Section 401 of the CrPC of 1898 has been quoted in paragraph 13 of the said decision, which reads thus: \"13. We are, however, clearly of opinion that for the purpose of Section 303 IPC it does not make any difference whether the remission under Section 401 CrPC is with or without conditions. This is clear from a perusal of sub-section (3) of Section 401 CrPC which reads as follows: \"401(3) If any condition on which a sentence has been suspended or remitted, is, in the opinion of the appropriate Government, not fulfilled, the appropriate Government may cancel the suspension or remission and thereupon the person in whose favour the sentence has been suspended or remitted, may, if at large, be arrested by any police officer without 1458 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports warrant and remanded to undergo the unexpired portion of the sentence.\" An identical provision is found in sub-section (3) of Section 432 of the CrPC and sub-section (3) of Section 473 of BNSS. Ultimately, in paragraph 14 of the said decision, while dealing with sub-section (3) of Section 401 of the CrPC of 1898, this Court held thus: \"14. It is manifest from the above provision that on breach of any condition of the remission there is not an automatic revival of the sentence. It will certainly be open to the Government in a particular case to cancel the remission but it may not. The Government is not under a legal obligation to cancel the remission. It is only when the Government chooses to pass an order of cancellation of the remission of sentence that the convict is arrested and is required to serve the unexpired portion of the sentence. During the interregnum the accused who is released cannot be said to be under a sentence of imprisonment for life. While he is in enjoyment of the freedom on account of remission, that period is not even reckoned under Section 401 CrPC for the purpose of calculation of the sentence to be served in the eventuality.\" (emphasis added) 15. The effect of remitting the sentence is the restoration of the liberty of a convict. If the order granting remission is to be cancelled or revoked, it will naturally affect the convict's liberty. The reason is that when an action is taken under sub-section (3) of Section 432 of the CrPC or sub- section (3) of Section 473 of the BNSS, it results in the convict being taken to prison for undergoing the remaining part of the sentence. Thus, the benefit of remission stands withdrawn. Therefore, this drastic power cannot be exercised without following the principles of natural justice. A show cause notice must be served on the convict before taking action to withdraw/cancel remission. The show cause notice must contain the grounds on which action under sub-section (3) of Section 432 of the CrPC or sub-section (3) of Section 473 of the BNSS is proposed to be taken. The concerned authority must give the convict an opportunity to file a reply and of being heard. After that, the authority must\n\n[2024] 10 S.C.R. 1459 Mafabhai Motibhai Sagar v. State of Gujarat & Ors. pass an order stating brief reasons. The principles of natural justice must be read into sub-section (3) of Section 432 and sub- section (3) of Section 473 of the BNSS. The convict whose remission has been cancelled can always adopt a remedy under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. 16. In view of the legal position stated above, condition no.2 cannot be interpreted to mean that every allegation of a breach thereof would automatically result in the cancellation of the order of remission. Registration of a cognizable offence against the convict, per se, is not a ground to cancel the remission order. The allegations of breach of condition cannot be taken at their face value, and whether a case for cancellation of remission is made out will have to be decided in the facts of each case. Every case of breach cannot invite cancellation of the order of remission. The appropriate Government will have to consider the nature of the breach alleged against the convict. A minor or a trifling breach cannot be a ground to cancel remission. There must be some material to substantiate the allegations of breach. Depending upon the seriousness and gravity thereof, action can be taken under sub-section (3) of Section 432 of the CrPC or sub-section (3) of Section 473 of the BNSS of cancellation of the order remitting sentence. 17. Our conclusions can be summarised as under: (i) Under sub-section (1) of Section 432 of the CrPC or sub-section (1) of Section 473 of the BNSS, the appropriate Government has the power to remit the whole or any part of the punishment of a convict. The remission can be granted either unconditionally or subject to certain conditions; (ii) The decision to grant or not to grant remission has to be well-informed, reasonable and fair to all concerned; (iii) A convict cannot seek remission as a matter of right. However, he has a right to claim that his case for the grant of remission ought to be considered in accordance with the law and/or applicable policy adopted by the appropriate Government; (iv) Conditions imposed while exercising the power under sub- section (1) of Section 432 or sub-section (1) of Section 473 of the BNSS must be reasonable. If the conditions imposed are arbitrary, the conditions will stand vitiated due to violation of 1460 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Article 14. Such arbitrary conditions may violate the convict's rights under Article 21 of the Constitution; (v) The effect of remitting the sentence, in part or full, results in the restoration of liberty of a convict. If the order granting remission is to be cancelled or revoked, it will naturally affect the liberty of the convict. The reason is that when action is taken under sub-section (3) of Section 432 of the CrPC or sub-section (3) of Section 473 of the BNSS, it results in the convict being taken to prison for undergoing the remaining part of the sentence. Therefore, this drastic power cannot be exercised without following the principles of natural justice. A show cause notice must be served on the convict before taking action to withdraw/cancel remission. The show cause notice must contain the grounds on which action under sub-section (3) of Section 432 of the CrPC or sub-section (3) of Section 473 of BNNS is sought to be taken. The concerned authority must give the convict an opportunity to file a reply and of being heard. After that, the authority must pass an order stating the reasons in brief. The convict can always challenge the order of cancellation of remission by adopting a remedy under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.; and (vi) Registration of a cognizable offence against the convict, per se, is not a ground to cancel the remission order. The allegations of breach of condition cannot be taken at their face value, and whether a case for cancellation of remission is made out will have to be decided in the facts of each case. Every case of breach cannot invite cancellation of the order of remission. The appropriate Government will have to consider the nature of the breach alleged against the convict. A minor or a trifling breach cannot be a ground to cancel remission. There must be some material to substantiate the allegations of breach. Depending upon the seriousness and gravity thereof, action can be taken under sub-section (3) of Section 432 of the CrPC or sub-section (3) of Section 473 of the BNSS of cancellation of the order remitting sentence. 18. Therefore, we pass the following order: a. The first part of condition no.1 regarding behaving decently, being manifestly arbitrary, is struck down. Therefore, the undertaking\n\n[2024] 10 S.C.R. 1461 Mafabhai Motibhai Sagar v. State of Gujarat & Ors. given by the appellant and the surety bonds submitted by him stand cancelled only to that extent; b. Condition no.2 stands clarified in terms of this judgment; c. The order of remission shall not be revoked on the ground of breaches of conditions without compliance with the principles of natural justice as provided in paragraph 17(v) above; and d. The Appeal is partly allowed on the above terms. Result of the case: Appeal partly allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Swathi H. Prasad, Hony.

Judgment / Order of the Supreme Court Judgment Pamidighantam Sri Narasimha, J. 1. By the present appeal, the suspended director of the Corporate Debtor assails the order of the NCLAT1 affirming the order of the Adjudicating Authority2 admitting the application under Section 7 1 National Company Law Appellate Tribunal in Company Appeal (AT) (Insolvency) No. 238 of 2020, dated 04.10.2021. 2 Adjudicating Authority/National Company Law Tribunal, Kolkata Bench, Kolkata order dated 13.12.2019 in CP No. 254/KB/2019. 1464 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports of IBC3 for initiating CIRP4 proceedings against the Corporate Debtor. 2. The undisputed facts before us are that the Corporate Debtor (respondent No. 2 herein), now represented by its Insolvency Resolution Professional (IRP), availed loan and credit facilities from UCO Bank (respondent No. 1 herein) and other consortium of banks under agreements dated 21.06.2010, 30.08.2012, 19.07.2012 and 31.12.2012. The said loan and other credit facilities were availed for funding of Corporate Debtor's Thermal Power Plant. 2.1 Having defaulted on repayment of principal as well as interest levied thereupon, Corporate Debtor's account was declared as Non-Performing Asset (NPA) on 05.11.2014. Further, proceedings under SARFAESI5 Act and DRT6 for recovery of dues were also initiated. However, we are not concerned with these proceedings for disposal of the present appeal. 3. The root of the present controversy arose on 13.02.2019 when UCO Bank filed an application under Section 7 of the Code to initiate CIRP proceeding against the Corporate Debtor before the Adjudicating Authority (NCLT, Kolkata Bench). These proceedings were resisted by the Corporate Debtor, primarily on the grounds of limitation. Additionally, the Section 7 application was also challenged on the grounds that it was not signed by a competent person and also that there is no liability to pay as per the terms of the agreement and as such there is no debt. 4. On the issue of competency of the Bank to file the petition under Section 7, the Adjudicating Authority held that the General Manager of Bank was legally authorized as attorney to do all acts and also act on behalf of the Bank and he had the authority to sign the application. On the issue relating to the existence of debt, the Adjudicating Authority, examined the contract, the terms and conditions of sanction letter as well as the relevant credit agreements in detail and came to the conclusion that the amount was disbursed as a loan and the Corporate Debtor had in-fact defaulted in repayment of principal as 3 Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016. 4 Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process. 5 Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest. 6 Debts Recovery Tribunal. [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1465 Vidyasagar Prasad v. UCO Bank & Anr. well as interest levied thereupon. Thus, the contention that there was no debt was also rejected. 4.1 The main objection to the initiation of CIRP proceedings on the ground of limitation was rejected by the Adjudicating Authority on the ground that there is an acknowledgement of debt in the financial statements as well as auditor's report of the Corporate Debtor for the year ending on 31.03.2017. On the basis of Section 238A of the Code, incorporating the Limitation Act, the Adjudicating Authority relied on Section 18 of the Limitation Act to reckon the period of limitation from the date of acknowledgement of the debt and concluded that the institution of CIRP on 13.02.2019 is within the period of limitation. The further contention of the Corporate Debtor that name of UCO Bank, the financial creditor, is not specifically mentioned in the relied upon entry in the balance sheet was rejected by NCLT by referring to the Explanation to Section 7(1) of the Code providing that the proceedings thereunder get triggered even in the case of a default by debtor in respect of any financial creditor other than the applicant. 5. Aggrieved by the admission of Section 7 application, initiation of CIRP and appointment of IRP, the appellant preferred an appeal to the NCLAT, Principal Bench. The same arguments were advanced before the NCLAT and having considered the same in detail, the NCLAT dismissed the appeal with the following reasoning: \"11.5 Therefore, in the instant case, the balance sheet that has been brought on record in the instant case before the Adjudicating Authority shall be taken into consideration while deciding the question of limitation and default on the part of the Corporate Debtor. The said documents cannot be ignored simply on the premise that it is not pleaded in the Application filed in Form-1 for initiation of the Corporate Insolvency Process. 11.6 We find that the balance sheet for the financial year ending on March 31 2017, was part of the record before the learned Adjudicating Authority and was annexed with Section 7 Application, which was also duly admitted by the Appellant during the hearing. Subsequently, the balance sheet for the financial year ending will March 31 2019,\n\n1466 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports was annexed with the reply filed by Respondent No. 1 before this Hon'ble Tribunal on March 02, 2020. However, as the practice and procedure of this Hon'ble Tribunal, the same was not accepted at the filing counter without the specific mention of this Hon'ble Tribunal. Accordingly, a copy of the Application for the additional document is also annexed as Annexure A. Subsequently; this Hon'ble Tribunal permitted such additional documents to be taken on record vide its Order dated July 15 2020. 11.7 The Company's balance sheet is prepared in the statutory format as per Schedule 3rd of the Companies Act 2013, which does not provide for giving the specific name of every secured or unsecured creditor. 11.8 It is further observed that the Corporate Debtor has not denied that there are no outstanding dues to the UCO Bank. A perusal of extract of register of charges submitted with ROC, at Sr. No. 3, shows that a charge of rupees one hundred and seventy-five crores created by the Corporate Debtor has not been satisfied and remains outstanding. 11.9 After the judgement of Hon'ble Supreme Court in case Asset Reconstruction Company (India) Limited v. Bishal Jaiswal (supra), it is settled that entries in books of accounts and/or balance sheets of a Corporate Debtor would amount to an acknowledgement under Section 18. 11.10 In the instant case, we also find that the Corporate Debtor issued a letter dated June 07 2016 (Annexure A Page 11 of their reply affidavit of R-1) wherein it has given OTS proposal. Based on the ratio of the judgement of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Lakshmirattan Cotton Mills Co Ltd and further reiterated in Dena Bank's case (supra) that there is an acknowledgement of subsisting liability of the Corporate Debtor. However, it may not necessarily specify the exact nature of the liability. But it indicates the jural relation between the parties, and in any event, the same can also be derived by implication. Further, the said Letter is not \"without prejudice\" basis and, therefore, amounts to an unequivocal acknowledgement of liability of the Corporate Debtor. A reading of the [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1467 Vidyasagar Prasad v. UCO Bank & Anr. documents above reveals that the Corporate Debtor has acknowledged/subsisting liability to attract the provisions of Section 18 of the Limitation Act, 1963. 11.11 Based on the discussion as above, we think that the present Appeal is liable to be dismissed, and the interim Order dated April 07, 2020, is exposed to vacated.\" 6. Mr. Balbir Singh, senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant has emphatically argued only one point before us. It is that there is no clear and unequivocal acknowledgement of debt of the Corporate Debtor in the entries of the balance sheets. If this is true, it is submitted, then the financial creditor cannot have the benefit of Section 18 of the Limitation Act to extend the period of limitation which commenced on 05.11.2014. 7. The commencement of a fresh period of limitation from the time of acknowledgement of the debt is part of the statutory scheme. Section 238A of the Code extends the applicability of the provisions of the Limitation Act to the proceedings under the Code. With the extension of Limitation Act to the provisions of the Code, the benefit of Section 18 of the Limitation Act dealing with the effect of acknowledgement of a debt in writing applies. Considering the same issue in Laxmi Pat Surana v. Union Bank of India7, the Court observed: \"42. Notably, the provisions of the Limitation Act have been made applicable to the proceedings under the Code, as far as may be applicable. For, Section 238-A predicates that the provisions of the Limitation Act shall, as far as may be, apply to the proceedings or appeals before the adjudicating authority, NCLAT, the DRT or the Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal, as the case may be. After enactment of Section 238-A IBC on 6-6-2018, validity whereof has been upheld by this Court, it is not open to contend that the limitation for filing application under Section 7 IBC would be limited to Article 137 of the Limitation Act and extension of prescribed period in certain cases could be only under Section 5 of the Limitation Act. There is no reason to exclude the effect of Section 18 of the Limitation Act to the proceedings initiated under the Code. 7 (2021) 8 SCC 481.\n\n1468 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 43. Ordinarily, upon declaration of the loan account/ debt as NPA that date can be reckoned as the date of default to enable the financial creditor to initiate action under Section 7 IBC. However, Section 7 comes into play when the corporate debtor commits \"default\". Section 7, consciously uses the expression \"default\" -- not the date of notifying the loan account of the corporate person as NPA. Further, the expression \"default\" has been defined in Section 3(12) to mean non-payment of \"debt\" when whole or any part or instalment of the amount of debt has become due and payable and is not paid by the debtor or the corporate debtor, as the case may be. In cases where the corporate person had offered guarantee in respect of loan transaction, the right of the financial creditor to initiate action against such entity being a corporate debtor (corporate guarantor), would get triggered the moment the principal borrower commits default due to non-payment of debt. Thus, when the principal borrower and/or the (corporate) guarantor admit and acknowledge their liability after declaration of NPA but before the expiration of three years therefrom including the fresh period of limitation due to (successive) acknowledgments, it is not possible to extricate them from the renewed limitation accruing due to the effect of Section 18 of the Limitation Act. Section 18 of the Limitation Act gets attracted the moment acknowledgment in writing signed by the party against whom such right to initiate resolution process under Section 7 IBC enures. Section 18 of the Limitation Act would come into play every time when the principal borrower and/or the corporate guarantor (corporate debtor), as the case may be, acknowledge their liability to pay the debt. Such acknowledgment, however, must be before the expiration of the prescribed period of limitation including the fresh period of limitation due to acknowledgment of the debt, from time to time, for institution of the proceedings under Section 7 IBC. Further, the acknowledgment must be of a liability in respect of which the financial creditor can initiate action under Section 7 IBC.\" (emphasis supplied) [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1469 Vidyasagar Prasad v. UCO Bank & Anr. 7.1 In Dena Bank v. C. Shivakumar Reddy8 after reviewing the case law on the subject, this Court held; \"138. While it is true that default in payment of a debt triggers the right to initiate the corporate resolution process, and a petition under Section 7 or 9 IBC is required to be filed within the period of limitation prescribed by law, which in this case would be three years from the date of default by virtue of Section 238-A IBC read with Article 137 of the Schedule to the Limitation Act, the delay in filing a petition in the NCLT is condonable under Section 5 of the Limitation Act unlike delay in filing a suit. Furthermore, as observed above Sections 14 and 18 of the Limitation Act are also applicable to proceedings under the IBC. ………… 140. To sum up, in our considered opinion an application under Section 7 IBC would not be barred by limitation, on the ground that it had been filed beyond a period of three years from the date of declaration of the loan account of the corporate debtor as NPA, if there were an acknowledgment of the debt by the corporate debtor before expiry of the period of limitation of three years, in which case the period of limitation would get extended by a further period of three years.\" (emphasis supplied) 7.2 A reference must also be made to a three Judge Bench decision in Rajendra Narottamdas Sheth v. Chandra Prakash Jain9 which succinctly observed; \"27. It is no more res integra that Section 18 of the Limitation Act is applicable to applications filed under Section 7 of the Code. In case the application under Section 7 is filed beyond the period of three years from the date of default and the financial creditor furnishes the required information relating to the acknowledgment of debt, in writing by the 8 [2021] 8 SCR 1061 : (2021) 10 SCC 330 9 [2021] 7 SCR 838 : (2022) 5 SCC 600\n\n1470 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports corporate debtor, before the adjudicating authority, with such acknowledgment having taken place within the initial period of three years from the date of default, a fresh period of limitation commences and the application can be entertained, if filed within this extended period.\" (emphasis supplied) 8. In view of the above referred principles, we will now consider the nuanced arguments advanced by Mr. Balbir Singh that there is no unequivocal, unambiguous and specific acknowledgement of debt owed to UCO Bank in the balance sheet entries of Corporate Debtor for the years 2017 and 2019. In the absence of clear demarcation as to what the Corporate Debtor owes to the UCO Bank, the said entries cannot be relied on for the purpose of extending the period of limitation in terms of Section 18 of the Limitation Act. Mr. Balbir Singh further argues that even if said entry is taken to be an acknowledgment of debt, the same cannot aid respondent No.1's case since it fails to mention the name of financial creditor. 8.1 Mr. Partha Sil, counsel on behalf of respondent No. 1-Bank submitted that the Balance Sheets of a company are prepared in the prescribed statutory format as per Section 129, read with Schedule III of the Companies Act 2013, which does not provide for giving specific names of each and every Secured and Unsecured creditor. In support of his submission, Mr. Partha Sil referred to the judgment in Asset Reconstruction Company (India) Ltd. v. Bishal Jaiswal10 where it was observed that there was no compulsion for Companies to make any particular admissions in the balance sheet, except for what is prescribed. 9. A three Judge Bench of this Court in Bishal Jaiswal (Supra) has addressed and clarified this issue by holding that; \"35. A perusal of the aforesaid sections would show that there is no doubt that the filing of a balance sheet in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act is mandatory, any transgression of the same being punishable by law. However, what is of importance is that notes that are annexed to or forming part of such financial statements 10 [2021] 3 SCR 524 : (2021) 6 SCC 366. [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1471 Vidyasagar Prasad v. UCO Bank & Anr. are expressly recognised by Section 134(7). Equally, the auditor's report may also enter caveats with regard to acknowledgments made in the books of accounts including the balance sheet. A perusal of the aforesaid would show that the statement of law contained in Bengal Silk Mills Co. v. Ismail Golam Hossain Ariff, that there is a compulsion in law to prepare a balance sheet but no compulsion to make any particular admission, is correct in law as it would depend on the facts of each case as to whether an entry made in a balance sheet qua any particular creditor is unequivocal or has been entered into with caveats, which then has to be examined on a case by case basis to establish whether an acknowledgment of liability has, in fact, been made, thereby extending limitation under Section 18 of the Limitation Act.\" (emphasis supplied) 10. Having considered the specific facts and circumstances of this case, the Adjudicating Authority as well as the NCLAT have concurrently held that the entries in the balance sheets amount to clear acknowledgment of debt. We agree with the findings. Further, Note 3.4 appended to said balance sheet entry dated 31.03.2017 mentions that \"company has made certain defaults in the repayment of term loans and interest.\" It further mentions of a continuing default. The entry also mentions long-term borrowings. The conclusions of NCLT and NCLAT that there is acknowledgment of debt are unimpeachable. 10.1 Following the principles as expounded in the case of Bishal Jaiswal (Supra), the Adjudicating Authority as well as the NCLAT have examined the case in detail and have come to the conclusion that the entry made in the balance sheet coupled with the note of the auditor of the appellant clearly amounts to acknowledgement of the liability. We see no reason whatsoever to take a different view of the matter. Their findings are fortified when we examine the matter from another perspective. 11. Adjudicating Authority and NCLAT have also considered the Corporate Debtor's proposal of One Time Settlement (OTS) to UCO Bank. The proposal made by letter dated 07.06.2016 acknowledges that there were prior debts owed to UCO Bank. To substantiate the argument that such OTS constituted acknowledgment of debt since it relates\n\n1472 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports to present and subsisting liability and indicates existence of a jural relationship between the parties, UCO Bank relied on judgment of this Court in Lakshmirattan Cotton Mills Co. Ltd. and Messrs Behari Lal Ram Charan v. Aluminium Corporation of India Limited11. The implication of a statement about a present and subsisting debt of a Corporate Debtor is articulated by this Court in the following manner; \"9. It is clear that the statement on which the plea of acknowledgment is founded must relate to a subsisting liability as the section requires that it must be made before the expiration of the period prescribed under the Act. It need not, however, amount to a promise to pay, for, an acknowledgment does not create a new right of action but merely extends the period of limitation. The statement need not indicate the exact nature or the specific character of the liability. The words used in the statement in question, however, must relate to a present subsisting liability and indicate the existence of jural relationship between the parties, such as, for instance, that of a debtor and a creditor and the intention to admit such jural relationship. Such an intention need not be in express terms and can be inferred by implication from the nature of the admission and the surrounding circumstances. Generally speaking, a liberal construction of the statement in question should be given. That of course does not mean that where a statement is made without intending to admit the existence of jural relationship, such intention should be fastened on the person making the statement by an involved and far- fetched reasoning…\" (emphasis supplied) 11.1 It is also relevant to refer to judgment in Dena Bank (Supra) which held as follows: \"139. Section 18 of the Limitation Act cannot also be construed with pedantic rigidity in relation to proceedings under the IBC. This Court sees no reason why an offer of one-time settlement of a live claim, made within the 11 (1971) 1 SCC 67 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1473 Vidyasagar Prasad v. UCO Bank & Anr. period of limitation, should not also be construed as an acknowledgment to attract Section 18 of the Limitation Act…\" (emphasis supplied) 12. Both these factors, acknowledgment of debt in the balance sheet as well as in the OTS proposal, have been considered by NCLAT while dismissing the appeal. The relevant portion of the NCLAT findings, after considering balance sheet entries and OTS letter are as follows: \"11.7 The Company's balance sheet is prepared in the statutory format as per Schedule 3rd of the Companies Act 2013, which does not provide for giving the specific name of every secured or unsecured creditor. 11.8 It is further observed that the Corporate Debtor has not denied that there are no outstanding dues to the UCO Bank. A perusal of extract of register of charges submitted with ROC, at Sr. No. 3, shows that a charge of rupees one hundred and seventy-five crores created by the Corporate Debtor has not been satisfied and remains outstanding. 11.10 In the instant case, we also find that the Corporate Debtor issued a letter dated June 07 2016 (Annexure A Page 11 of their reply affidavit of R-1) wherein it has given OTS proposal. Based on the ratio of the judgement of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Lakshmirattan Cotton Mills Co Ltd and further reiterated in Dena Bank's case (supra) that there is an acknowledgement of subsisting liability of the Corporate Debtor. However, it may not necessarily specify the exact nature of the liability. But it indicates the jural relation between the parties, and in any event, the same can also be derived by implication. Further, the said Letter is not \"without prejudice\" basis and, therefore, amounts to an unequivocal acknowledgement of liability of the Corporate Debtor. A reading of the documents above reveals that the Corporate Debtor has acknowledged/subsisting liability to attract the provisions of Section 18 of the Limitation Act, 1963.\" 13. Having examined the matter in detail, we are of the opinion that the findings arrived at by the Adjudicating Authority and NCLAT are\n\n1474 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports correct in law and fact. We find no merit in the appeal. The Civil Appeal No. 1031 of 2022 arising out of the NCLAT order dated 04.10.2021 (Company Appeal (AT) (Insolvency) No. 238 of 2020) is dismissed accordingly. 14. No order as to costs.

This appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 19.08.2025, passed by learned Single Judge of the High Court of Delhi, by which the application preferred by the appellant under Section 483 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 ('BNSS') read with Section 45 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 ('PMLA') seeking grant of regular bail, came to be rejected. 3. The appellant is a former promoter and non-executive Chairman of Amtek Auto Ltd. (AAL), and is also non-executive Director of M/s. ACIL Ltd., a company registered under the Companies Act. The group of companies including subsidiaries and associate concerns is collectively referred to as the \"Amtek Group\". During the period 2017-2018, Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) was initiated against entities belonging to Amtek Group. 4. FIRs were registered on 21.12.2022 at the instance of IDBI Bank and Bank of Maharashtra alleging commission of offences under Sections 120B, 420, 406, 468 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 13(2) and 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, wherein the appellant was arrayed as an accused along with twenty seven other individuals. In the aforementioned FIRs there is an allegation of fraud to the extent of INR 385.35 crores and INR 289 crores respectively. On the basis of the said FIRs on 21.03.2023, the Directorate of Enforcement registered two ECIRs alleging laundering of proceeds of crime. 5. A Writ Petition under Article 32 of the Constitution of India, being W.P. Criminal No(s). 246 of 2022 (Jaskaran Singh Chawla vs. Union of India and Ors.) was filed before this Court alleging failure of CBI and the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) to investigate frauds allegedly committed by Amtek Group involving diversion and siphoning of bank loans amounting to Rs.33,400 crores. A two-Judge Bench of this Court, by an interim order dated 27.02.2024, directed [2026] 1 S.C.R. 123 Arvind Dham v. Directorate of Enforcement the CBI and SFIO to conduct an exhaustive investigation and to cooperate with and complement the Enforcement Directorate in the collection of evidence. 6. The gravamen of the allegation against the appellant is that he is the ultimate beneficiary of the fraud which was a well-orchestrated scheme, executed at his behest, involving diversion and siphoning of public funds through layered entities, resulting in substantial wrongful loss to Public Sector Banks. 7. The appellant, in response to the summons issued to him under Section 50 of the PMLA, appeared on 19.06.2024 and his statement was recorded. The respondent carried out search and seizure operations on 20.06.2024, at the residence of the appellant and his statement was again recorded. The appellant was arrested on 09.07.2024. A prosecution complaint dated 06.09.2024 was filed against 16 accused persons i.e., six individuals and ten companies, wherein, appellant was arrayed as an accused. Thereafter a supplementary prosecution complaint was filed on 02.08.2025 against 40 accused persons i.e., 22 individuals and 18 companies. Out of 28 individuals, only the appellant has been arrested and is in custody. A total number of 208 prosecution witnesses have been cited. The cognizance of prosecution complaint is yet to be taken. 8. On 16.12.2024, the appellant moved an application under Section 45 of the PMLA for seeking bail before the Special Judge. The Special Judge by an order dated 21.01.2025 dismissed the application on the ground that the appellant is not covered by proviso to Section 45 of the PMLA. Thereafter, on 04.02.2025, the appellant approached the High Court by filing an application under Section 483 of the BNNS and Section 45 of PMLA, along with an application for interim bail. The appellant was granted interim bail on medical grounds on 11.03.2025 till 01.04.2025. By the impugned order dated 19.08.2025, the High Court rejected application for regular bail. 9. Learned senior counsel for the appellant submitted that appellant is aged about 64 years and suffers from multiple ailments. It is further submitted that appellant is in custody for past about 16 months and 20 days and his long incarceration, is violative of the Right to Liberty and speedy trial under Article 21 of the Constitution. In support of the 124 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports aforesaid submission, reliance is placed on decisions of this Court1. It is pointed out that out of 28 individuals only the appellant has been arrested and investigation qua the appellant stands concluded. In this connection, reference has been made to order dated 20.08.2025 passed by the Special Court which records the submission of the ED. It is, therefore, contended that the custody of the appellant is no longer required. It is urged that no cognizance of the prosecution complaint has been taken and the matter is at the stage of scrutiny of documents. 10. It is submitted that there is no likelihood of trial commencing in foreseeable future. It is pointed out that delay in trial of approximately eight months is attributable to the respondent, as it had filed Crl. MC No.7860 of 2024 before the High Court challenging the order dated 07.09.2024 issuing notice to the proposed accused person. It is pointed out that in the said proceeding, the High Court had granted an interim order of deferment of proceeding before the Special Judge and after eight months, respondent, on 23.05.2025, withdrew the said proceeding. 11. It is urged that the appellant has cooperated with the investigation and the allegation with regard to influencing the witness, Ms. Anuradha Kapur, is incredulous as the appellant has been in custody since 09.07.2024 and aforesaid Ms. Anuradha Kapur has been arrayed as a witness in supplementary prosecution complaint dated 02.08.2025. Therefore, the question of instructing the said witness not to join the investigation prior to issue of summons to her does not arise. It is pointed out that all close family members of the appellant have fully participated in the investigation. It is contended that the appellant is in custody since 09.07.2024 and has no knowledge of dissipation of properties at Panipat and Alwar. It is submitted that the appellant is not the Director of M/s. Marichika Properties and, therefore, has no knowledge about dissipation of properties mentioned in the chart at page 125 of the counter affidavit. 1 Manish Sisodia v. Enforcement Directorate, (2024) 12 SCC 660, Padam Chand Jain v. Enforcement Directorate, 2025 SCC OnLine SC 1291, Udhaw Singh v. Directorate Enforcement, 2025 SCC OnLine SC 357, Prem Prakash v.

It is submitted that the allegations in the predicate offence allege a total bank fraud to the tune of INR 673.35 crores, therefore, the figure of INR 38,000 crores is deliberately exaggerated to project the instant case as India's largest bank fraud to justify the prolonged custody of the appellant. It is urged that it is settled law that economic offences cannot be classified as separate class on its own for determination of grant of bail2. It is also stated that the appellant is neither a flight risk nor can he tamper with the evidence. Therefore, the appellant is entitled to be enlarged on bail. 13. On the other hand, learned Additional Solicitor General submitted that the gravity of the offence disentitles the appellant from seeking any exemption from the mandatory twin conditions of bail under Section 45 of the PMLA. It is further submitted that the appellant is an influential person and had instructed his cousin, Ms. Anuradha Kapur, who is a dummy director in his group of companies, not to join the investigation. It is also submitted that the appellant has dissipated the proceeds of crime i.e., immovable properties at Alwar and Panipat after attachment. It is contended that mere incarceration for a long period cannot be a sole ground for bail, ignoring the gravity of an offence especially when there are allegations of tampering with evidence and influencing witnesses3. It is contended that delay in trial, if any, is attributable to the appellant, which is evident from the order sheet of the Trial Court. It is further contended that the proviso to Section 45(1) of the PMLA has no application to the facts of the case. 14. It is submitted that out of 210 witnesses to be examined during the trial, 25 witnesses are common in both the prosecution complaints. It is pointed out that out of 63,691 pages of relied upon documents, only few pages are relevant to prove the loss. It is further pointed out that ED has filed an application on 27.09.2025 for day-to-day hearing. It is submitted that the appeal is liable to be dismissed. Alternatively, it is also pointed out that in many serious cases, this Court has directed the parties to re-apply for bail after sometime4 and 2 P. Chidambaram v. Directorate of Enforcement, (2020) 13 SCC 791. 3 Kalyan Chandra Sarkar v. Rajesh Ranjan, (2004) 7 SCC 528 and B. Rajesh Ranjan Yadav v. CBI, (2007) 1 SCC 70. 4 Bimal Kumar Jain v. Directorate of Enforcement, SLP (Crl.) No. 7942/2021. 126 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports the appellant, depending upon the progress of the trial, be directed to renew the prayer for bail after six months. 15. We have given our thoughtful consideration to the rival submissions and have carefully perused the record. The court while dealing with the prayer for grant of bail has to consider gravity of offence, which has to be ascertained in the facts and circumstances of each case. One of the circumstances to consider the gravity of offences is also the term of sentence i.e., prescribed for the offence, the accused is alleged to have committed5. The court has also to take into account the object of the special Act, the gravity of offence and the attending circumstances along with period of sentence. All economic offences cannot be classified into one group as it may involve various activities and may differ from one case to another. Therefore, it is not advisable on the part of the Court to categorize all the offences into one group and deny bail on that basis6. It is well settled that if the State or any prosecuting agency including, the court, concerned has no wherewithal to provide or protect the fundamental right of an accused, to have a speedy trial as enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution, then the State or any other prosecuting agency should not oppose the plea for bail on the ground that the crime committed is serious. Article 21 of the Constitution applies irrespective of the nature of the crime7. The aforesaid proposition was quoted with approval by another two-Judge Bench of this Court and it was held that long period of incarceration for around 17 months and the trial not even having commenced, the appellant in that case has been deprived of his right to speedy trial8. 16. A two-Judge Bench of this Court in V. Senthil Balaji's case9 has held that under the statutes such as PMLA, where maximum sentence is seven years, prolonged incarceration pending trial may warrant grant of bail by Constitutional Courts, if there is no likelihood of the trial concluding within a reasonable time. Statutory restrictions cannot be permitted to result in indefinite pretrial detention in violation of Article 21. 5 P. Chidambaram (supra) 6 Satender Kumar Antil v. CBI (2022) 10 SCC 51 7 Javed Gulam Nabi Shaikh v. State of Maharashtra & Anr. (2024) 9 SCC 813. 8 Manish Sisodia (supra) 9 V. Senthil Balaji v. Deputy Director, Enforcement Directorate, 2024 SCC OnLine SC 2626 [2026] 1 S.C.R. 127 Arvind Dham v. Directorate of Enforcement 17. A three Judge Bench of this Court in Padam Chand Jain (supra), reiterated that prolonged incarceration cannot be allowed to convert pretrial detention into punishment and that documentary evidence already seized by the prosecution eliminates the possibility of tampering with the same. 18. The right to speedy trial, enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution, is not eclipsed by the nature of the offence. Prolonged incarceration of an undertrial, without commencement or reasonable progress of trial, cannot be countenanced, as it has the effect of converting pretrial detention into form of punishment. Economic offences, by their very nature, may differ in degree and fact, and therefore cannot be treated as homogeneous class warranting a blanket denial of bail. 19. In the backdrop of aforesaid well settled parameters with regard to exercise of jurisdiction for grant of bail in economic offences, we now advert to the facts of the case in hand. The appellant has joined the investigation even prior to his arrest i.e., 19.06.2024 and 02.07.2024 as well as on 09.07.2024. Thus, he has cooperated with the investigation. Out of 28 individuals, only the appellant has been arrested. The order dated 20.08.2025 of the Special Court records the submission of ED that investigation qua the appellant has concluded. The maximum sentence which can be imposed on the appellant is seven years. The appellant is in custody for past around 16 months and 20 days. It is pertinent to note that various Benches of this Court, while taking into account the period of incarceration which ranges from 3 months to 17 months in several cases have granted bail to the appellants therein10. In the instant case, no cognizance has been taken on the prosecution complaint and the proceeding is at the stage of scrutiny of documents. No material has been placed on record to show the fate of the application filed by the ED on 27.09.2025 seeking day-to-day hearing even after period of approximately three months has expired. There are 210 witnesses 10 P. Chidambaram (supra) (three months), Kalvakuntla Kavitha v. Directorate of Enforcement, 2024 SCC OnLine SC 2269 (five months), Sanjay Agarwal v. Directorate of Enforcement, 2022 SCC OnLine SC 1748 (ten months), Sanjay Agarwal v. Directorate of Enforcement, 2022 SCC OnLine SC 1748 (eleven months), Ramkripal Meena v. Directorate of Enforcement, 2024 SCC OnLine SC 2276 (thirteen months), Anil Tuteja v. Directorate of Enforcement, SLP (Crl) No.3148 of 2025 (Order dated 15.04.2025), V. Senthil Balaji (supra) (fifteen months), Neeraj Singal v. Directorate of Enforcement, 2024 SCC OnLine SC 3598 (sixteen months), Abdul Razak Peediyakkal v. UOI, 2023 SCC OnLine SC 2326 (seventeen months) and Manish Sisodia (supra) (seventeen months) 128 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports to be examined in the proceeding. There is no likelihood of trial commencing in the near future. The continued incarceration in such circumstances, particularly where the evidence which is primarily documentary in nature, is already in custody of the prosecution, violates the right of the appellant to speedy trial under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. 20. As regards the allegation that the appellant instructed Ms. Anuradha Kapur not to join the investigation, the same does not inspire confidence, particularly, in view of the fact that appellant has been in custody prior to concerned witness being formally arrayed as a witness. It is noteworthy that the appellant is in custody since 09.07.2024 and Ms. Kapur was arrayed as a witness only on 02.08.2025. The allegation, therefore, is wholly incredulous. 21. The record reveals that the prosecution complaint was filed on 06.09.2024. The Special Judge issued notice on 07.09.2024 to all proposed accused persons under the proviso to Section 223 of BNSS. The respondent challenged the said order before the High Court, resulting in eight months stay of proceedings, before the Special Judge, which was lifted on 23.05.2025 only upon withdrawal of the petition. The delay in the trial is thus attributable only to the respondent, not the appellant. 22. The appellant has been in custody since 09.07.2024. The disposal of immovable properties occurred on 24.12.2024 and 17.02.2025 and pertains to M/s Marichika Properties, with which no material link to the appellant has been established. There is no evidence that the appellant was signatory to any sale document. The allegation of dissipation of proceeds of crime by him is, therefore, untenable at this stage. 23. For the foregoing reasons, the impugned judgment and order dated 19.08.2025 is quashed and set aside. The appellant-Arvind Dham shall be released on bail during the pendency of the trial arising out of prosecution complaint-ECIR Case Nos. ECIR/GNZO/13/2024 and ECIR/GNZO/14/2024, pending before the Special Judge (PC Act) (CBI)-02(Duty Judge), Rouse Avenue District Court, under provisions of the PMLA. The terms and conditions for grant of bail shall be fixed by the Trial Court.\n\n[2026] 1 S.C.R. 129 Arvind Dham v. Directorate of Enforcement 24. In addition, the appellant will provide one telephone/mobile No. on which he can be contacted by the Officers of Directorate of Enforcement to ascertain his whereabouts while he is on bail. The appellant shall surrender his passport to the Trial Court and will not leave India without permission of the Trial Court. 25. In the result, the appeal is allowed. Result of the case: Appeal allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain", "2026_1_130_140_EN_2026": "[2026] 1 S.C.R. 130 : 2026 INSC 14 UV Asset Reconstruction Company Limited v.

Judgment / Order of the Supreme Court Judgment Alok Aradhe, J. INTRODUCTION 1. This appeal under Section 62 of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (hereinafter, referred to as the 'Code') calls in question the legality and correctness of the judgment dated 24.01.2024 by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), whereby, the NCLAT affirmed the order dated 24.06.2022 passed by the Adjudicating Authority (NCLT) rejecting the application filed by the appellant under Section 7 of the Code. (ii) ISSUE 2. The central issue arising for consideration in the present appeal pertains to the interpretation of Clause 2.2 of Deed of Undertaking dated 27.07.2011 executed between SREI Infrastructure Finance Limited (SREI), the original creditor, which subsequently assigned all its rights and interests in favour of UV Asset Reconstruction Company Limited, the appellant; Electrosteel Steels Limited (ESL), the borrower; and Electrosteel Castings Limited (ECL), the erstwhile promoter of ESL and obligor in the Deed of Undertaking. The Controversy lies in determining whether said Clause constitutes a contract of guarantee within the meaning of Section 126 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 (Act) thereby rendering ECL as a guarantor to SREI in respect of financial facilities availed by ESL from SREI. 134 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports (iii) FACTUAL BACKGROUND 3. Briefly stated, the facts leading to filing of present appeal, are as follows. ESL availed financial assistance of INR 500 crores from SREI pursuant to sanction letter dated 26.07.2011. Under the sanction letter, the only security for the facility comprised a demand promissory note and post-dated cheques. The sanction letter did not stipulate any requirement for a personal or corporate guarantee from the ECL. However, ECL being the promoter of ESL was required to furnish an undertaking to arrange for the infusion of funds. 4. On the same day, SREI issued an addendum to the sanction letter, providing for an additional security for the facility in the form of subservient charge over movable and project assets of ESL. On 26.07.2011 itself, SREI and ESL executed a Rupee Loan Agreement. Clause (d)(3) of schedule 4 to the loan agreement, required the ECL to furnish an undertaking to arrange for infusion of funds to enable ESL, to comply with financial covenants. 5. In pursuance thereof, ECL, one of the promotors of ESL, executed a Deed of Undertaking, warranty, and indemnity dated 27.07.2011 (undertaking) whereby it undertook a limited obligation to arrange for infusion of funds into ESL. Clause 2.2 of the aforesaid guarantee provides that ECL shall arrange for infusion of such amount of funds into the ESL, as may be necessary to enable ESL to comply with stipulated financial covenants. 6. Subsequently on 21.11.2011, ESL, ECL and SREI entered into a supplementary agreement amending inter alia the facility agreement and the security package for the facility. (iv) CORPORATE INSOLVENCY RESOLUTION PROCESS OF ESL 7. On 27.06.2017, State Bank of India, one of the lenders of ESL, filed an application on 27.06.2017 under Section 7 of the Code, before NCLT Kolkata, which was admitted on 20.07.2017. Thereafter, by an order dated 17.04.2018, passed under Section 31 (1) of the Code, the NCLT Kolkata, approved the resolution plan submitted by Vedanta for acquisition of ESL. Under the approved resolution plan, ESL was acquired for a total consideration of INR 12,719.14 crores, comprising upfront cash payment of INR 5,320.00 crores [2026] 1 S.C.R. 135 UV Asset Reconstruction Company Limited v. Electrosteel Castings Limited and conversion of balance amount into equity shares. The resolution plan duly was implemented. 8. Upon implementation of the resolution plan, SREI issued an unconditional 'no due certificate' to ESL certifying that dues owned by ESL to SREI stood fully discharged. However, SREI subsequently claimed that it has been allotted reduced amount of shares upon conversion of balance debt. On 30.06.2018, SREI executed a Deed of Assignment (Assignment Deed) in favour of the appellant, purporting to assign the alleged residual debt. (v) PROCEEDING BEFORE NCLT 9. The appellant thereafter filed an application under Section 7 of the Code before the NCLT, Cuttack, asserting that; (i) a residual financial debt, remained payable by ESL despite implementation of the resolution plan, and (ii) ECL has furnished a corporate guarantee for the debt of ESL. 10. The NCLT, by order dated 24.06.2022, dismissed the petition filed by the appellant under Section 7 of the Code on two principal grounds; (i) ECL was not a guarantor in respect of financial facilities availed by ESL and, therefore no financial debt was owed by ECL, and (ii) the conversion of ESL's debt into equity under resolution plan resulted in extinguishment of any liability of ECL. (vi) PROCEEDING BEFORE NCLAT 11. Aggrieved thereby, the appellant preferred an appeal before the NCLAT. The NCLAT in its judgment dated 24.01.2024 framed two specific issues for adjudication namely, (i) whether ECL was a guarantor to SREI for the financial facilities availed by ESL and (ii) whether approval of the resolution plan of ESL resulted in extinguishment, of entire debt, so as to bar any claim against the ECL as a guarantor or third party surety. 12. The NCLAT answered the first issue in the negative, holding that ECL cannot be construed as a guarantor under Clause 2.2 of Deed of Undertaking in respect of the financial facility extended by SREI to ESL. While answering the second issue, it held that approval of resolution plan extinguished the debt, qua ESL i.e., corporate debtor alone. It was further held that such extinguishment did not by 136 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports itself, extend to third parties unless expressly provided in the plan. Nonetheless, the appeal was dismissed on the primary finding that ECL was not a guarantor. Hence, the present appeal. (vii) RIVAL SUBMISSIONS 13. Learned senior counsel for the appellant contended that Clause 2.2 of the Deed of Undertaking, satisfies the requirements of a contract of guarantee as defined under Section 126 of the Act. It is submitted that Clause 2.2 envisages the ECL to discharge the obligation to infuse funds upon default of ESL in compliance of financial covenants. It is argued that Clause 2.2 involves two step process of discharging liability as a guarantor namely, (i) the first step is to fund ESL for such amounts, and (ii) second step is to eliminate the breach of default on the part of the borrower. It is submitted that the guarantee in question is \"See to it\" type guarantee. In support of aforesaid submission, reliance has been placed on the decisions of House of Lords1 and Court of Appeal2. 14. It is argued that ECL had admitted its status as a guarantor in the pleadings before the Madras High Court3 and this Court4 and is therefore, estopped5 from taking a contrary stand. Our attention has also been invited to the letters dated 30.06.2017 and 20.07.2017 sent by ESL to SREI, evidencing payment of INR 38 Crores by ECL to SREI which according to the appellant, reinforces the existence of guarantee obligation. It is urged that NCLAT erred in relying upon the sanction letter dated 26.07.2011 and information memorandum dated 27.10.2017 to negate the existence of the guarantee and the impugned order warrants interference in this appeal. 15. On the other hand, learned senior counsel for the respondent submitted that Clause 2.2 of the Deed of Undertaking, imposed only an obligation to arrange for infusion of funds and did not amount to a guarantee under Section 126 of the Act.

[2026] 1 S.C.R. 137 UV Asset Reconstruction Company Limited v. Electrosteel Castings Limited aforesaid submissions, reliance has been placed on the decisions of Bombay, Karnataka and Delhi High Courts6. It is pointed out that even the appellant in its pleading before NCLAT has admitted that undertaking is not a contract of guarantee. It is also pointed out that the sanction letter by SREI does not envisage facility being secured by any personal or corporate guarantee. It is contended that 'see to it' guarantee is not the type of guarantee contemplated under Section 126 of the Act and has not been adopted in Indian Common Law. It is submitted that ECL made a payment of INR 38 crores to SREI on 20.07.2017 on its own volition, in its capacity as promotor of ESL. It is further submitted that aforesaid payment was not made on account of any contractual obligation. 16. It is also urged that, it is well settled, that pleadings must be read as a whole and cannot be read selectively, out of context or in isolation. It is pointed out that the pleading was filed by the ECL in the proceeding initiated by the appellant to enforce mortgage security created by ECL in favour of SREI. In the said pleading, it was stated that ECL has given a guarantee which is limited only to the mortgage property and the same is not personal. It is urged that reliance on the decisions in Nagindas Ramdas and Mumbai International Airport Pvt. Ltd. is misplaced. It is finally urged that detailed and reasoned orders passed by the NCLT and NCLAT do not call for any interference in this appeal. (viii) ANALYSIS 17. We have given our thoughtful consideration to the rival submissions and have carefully perused the records. Section 126 of the Act defines a 'Contract of Guarantee', as a contract to perform promise, or discharge the liability, of a third person in case of his default. The essential ingredients of a guarantee, therefore, are (a) existence of principal debt, (b) default by the principal debtor and (c) a promise by the surety to discharge the liability of the principal debtor upon such default. Thus, a guarantee is a promise to answer for the payment of some debt, or the performance of some duty, in case of failure of 6 Yes Bank Limited v. Zee Entertainment Enterprises Limited and Ors, 2020 SCC OnLine Bom 11763 (Paras 50,53,59,62,67), United Breweries (Holding) Ltd. v. Karnataka State Industrial Investment and Development Corporation Ltd. and Others, 2011 SCC OnLine Kar 4012 (para 6,9) and Aditya Birla Finance Ltd. vs. Siti Networks, 2023 SCC OnLine Del 1290 (Para 26,237,238). 138 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports another party, who is in the first instance, liable to such payment or performance7. A guarantee is a security in the form of right of action against a third party. In order to constitute a guarantee, there has to be a specific undertaking or unambiguous affirmation to discharge the liability of a third person in case of their default. 18. A guarantee is governed by principles of construction generally governing other documents8. A guarantee being a mercantile contract, the Court does not apply to it merely technical rules but construes it so as to reflect what may fairly be inferred to have been the parties' real intention and understanding as expressed by them in writing and to give effect to it rather than not9. 19. Now, we advert to Clause 2.2 of Deed of Undertaking dated 27.07.2011, which reads as under: - \"2.2. Financial Covenants In the event the Borrower is not in a position to comply with the Financial Covenants in the Financing Documents, or has breached such Financial Covenants, the Obligors will arrange for the infusion of such amount of fund into the Borrower such that the Borrower is in a position to comply with the abovementioned Financial Covenants.\" Thus, the aforesaid Clause obligates ECL to arrange for infusion of funds into ESL, so as to enable the borrower to comply with the stipulated Financial Covenants. 20. For an obligation to be construed as a guarantee under Section 126 of the Act, there must be a direct and unambiguous obligation of the surety to discharge the obligation of the principal debtor to the creditor. The clause neither records an undertaking to discharge the debt owed to the creditor nor does it contemplate payment to the lender in the event of the default. The clause contains a promise, not to the creditor to pay the debt upon default, but to the borrower to facilitate compliance with Financial Covenants. An undertaking to 7 Conley (Re), ex p Trustee v Barclays Bank Ltd. (1938) 2 All ER 127, at 130-131 (CA) 8 Raghunandan v. Kirtyanand, AIR 1932 PC 131, Eshelby v Federated European Bank Ltd.

Thakhratmal Land, AIR 1964 SC 859 9 Halsbury's Laws of England, Vol 49, 5th Edition and Perrylease Ltd v Imecar AG, (1987) 2 All ER 378 [2026] 1 S.C.R. 139 UV Asset Reconstruction Company Limited v. Electrosteel Castings Limited infuse funds into a borrower, so that it may meet its obligations cannot, by itself be equated with the promise to discharge the borrower's liability to the creditor. A mere Covenant to ensure financial discipline or infusion of funds does not satisfy the statutory requirements of Section 126 of the Act. 21. The sanction letter dated 26.07.2011 does not contemplate any personal or corporate guarantee. On the contrary, it specifically identifies the securities for the facilities and does not require ECL to stand as surety. The fact that no guarantee was furnished by ECL is also borne out from the following documents: (i) information memorandum in the CIRP of ESL does not reflect any guarantee from the Respondent in connection with SREI's Facility under the category of Guarantee or Security Interest; (ii) In Schedule 1 to the Assignment Agreement, against the column titled \"details of the guarantor/co-borrower\", the parties to Assignment Agreement stated 'Nil' and (iii) Audited Financial Statement of ESL does not reflect any guarantee obligation towards SREI. Thus, contemporaneous documents reinforce the conclusion that parties never intended to create a contract of guarantee. 22. Section 126 of the Act mandates a guarantor to 'perform a promise' or 'discharge the liability' of a third person which necessarily implies a direct performance or discharge. A 'See to it' guarantee in English Common Law refers to an obligation upon the guarantor to ensure that principal debtor itself, performs its own obligation and the guarantor, therefore, is in breach as soon as principal debtor fails to perform. However, a 'See to it' guarantee does not include an obligation to enable the principal debtor to perform its own obligation. Such an arrangement would not be a guarantee under Section 126 of the Act. 23. It is pertinent to note that payment of an amount of INR 38 crores by ECL to the appellant was not made on account of any contractual obligation. The said payment was made on 20.07.2017 in its capacity as a promotor of ESL. Such payment by itself does not give rise to any contract of guarantee, particularly when there is no contractual obligation of guarantee in the Deed of Undertaking. 24. It is well settled in law, that, pleadings must be read as a whole and cannot be read selectively out of context or in isolation. The appellant had initiated an action to enforce the mortgage security created by ECL in favour of SREI. In the aforesaid proceeding, ECL\n\n140 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports in its pleadings stated that it has given a guarantee which is limited to the mortgaged property with no personal recourse to ECL. The reliance of the appellant on the decisions of Nagindas Ramdas and Mumbai International Airport Pvt. Ltd., is misconceived, as the aforesaid decisions are an authority for the proposition that if admissions are true and clear, they are the best proof of facts, admitted in the context of Section 58 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. Therefore, the aforesaid decisions have no application to the fact situation of the case. (ix) CONCLUSION 25. For the aforementioned reasons, we concur with the concurrent findings of NCLT and NCLAT that Clause 2.2 of the Deed of Undertaking does not constitute a contract of guarantee and that ECL cannot be treated as guarantor for the financial facilities availed by ESL. We, therefore, do not find any infirmity in the impugned judgment warranting interference in this appeal. 26. In the result, the appeal is dismissed. There shall be no order as to costs. Result of the case: Appeal dismissed. †Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain", "2026_1_141_166_EN_2026": "[2026] 1 S.C.R. 141 : 2026 INSC 15 Union of India v. G. Kiran & Ors.

Assailing the final judgment and order dated 06.08.2019 passed in Writ Petition No. 18947 of 2016 (S-CAT) connected with Writ Petition No. 54254 of 2016 (S-CAT) by the High Court of Karnataka at Bengaluru (hereinafter referred to as 'High Court'), the appellants have filed these appeals. For the sake of brevity, we will refer to the parties as per their status in Civil Appeal arising out of Special Leave Petition (C) No. 4743 of 2020. 3. The dispute in the present appeals is regarding the claim of a reserved category candidate i.e., Respondent No. 1, who availed relaxation in the Preliminary Examination but was placed higher in merit than the unreserved candidate i.e., Respondent No. 3 in the final merit 146 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports list based on total marks awarded in Main Examination (Written) and Personality Test, to be treated as a General merit candidate for the purpose of cadre allocation against a General Insider vacancy for State of Karnataka in the Indian Forest Service (hereinafter referred to as 'IFS'). 4. Being aggrieved by the notification dated 13.03.2015 issued by the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (hereinafter referred to as 'MoEFCC'), allocating Tamil Nadu Cadre to Respondent No. 1 instead of Karnataka, Respondent No. 1 preferred an Original Application No. 170/239 of 2015 (hereinafter referred to as 'OA') before the Central Administrative Tribunal, Bangalore Bench (hereinafter referred to as 'Tribunal') and vide order dated 15.03.2016, the Tribunal allowed the Original Application holding that a meritorious Scheduled Caste (hereinafter referred to as 'SC') candidate cannot be denied allocation against a General vacancy solely on the ground of availing relaxation in the SC cut-off marks at the stage of Preliminary Examination. The Tribunal directed to allocate the General Insider vacancy in the State of Karnataka to Respondent No. 1. Being aggrieved by the said order, WP No. 18947 of 2016 (S-CAT) was filed by Respondent No. 3 (who was allocated the General insider vacancy) and WP No. 54254 of 2016 (S-CAT) was filed by the Union of India (hereinafter referred to as 'UOI'), which came to be dismissed by the common impugned order of the High Court, affirming the view of the Tribunal. Hence, the present appeals. FACTUAL MATRIX 5. Prequel to the present litigation, the MoEFCC issued Notification No. 17011/01/2013-IFS-II dated 05.03.2013 publishing 'The Rules for a competitive examination to be held by the Union Public Service Commission in 2013' (hereinafter referred to as 'Exam Rules, 2013') for the purpose of filling vacancies in the Indian Forest Service. 6. Respondent No. 1, belongs to SC category and Respondent No. 3 belongs to General category. Both appeared for the Preliminary Examination in the year 2013. As per Exam Rules, 2013, the selection process for IFS involved following two tiers - (i) the Civil Services (Preliminary) Examination for purpose of screening; and (ii) the Indian Forest Service (Main) Examination followed by an Interview for personality test. [2026] 1 S.C.R. 147 Union of India v. G. Kiran & Ors. 7. It is undisputed that in the Preliminary Examination, the cut-off to qualify by General Category candidates was 267 and the cut-off to qualify by SC category candidates was 233. Respondent No. 1 secured 247.18 marks, which was below the cut-off to qualify as General category candidate, however, declared qualified for the Main Examination availing the relaxed cut-off applicable to SC candidates. Simultaneously, Respondent No. 3 secured 270.68 marks in the Preliminary Exam and qualified for the Main Examination (Written) as the said score was above the cut-off for General category. The details of the marks obtained has been tabulated for ready reference as under: - Name of Candidate Category Qualifying Marks (as Marks Obtained availed for (for in the purpose of purpose of Preliminary Preliminary Preliminary Exam Exam) Exam) G Kiran SC 233 247.18 [Respondent No. 1] Antony S Mariyappa General/ 267 270.68 [Respondent No. 3] Unreserved 8. Both the candidates appeared in the Main Examination (Written) in October 2013 and qualified the same. They appeared in Interview for personality test in December 2013. After all the stages of exam and on the basis of marks secured by respective candidates in the Main Examination and Interview, on 29th January 2014, the Union Public Service Commission (hereinafter referred to as 'UPSC') recommended total 85 candidates for appointment as IFS. 9. In the final merit list, Respondent No. 1 was placed at rank 19 while Respondent No. 3 came to be placed at rank 37. Consequent thereto, controversy was set into motion during the allocation of cadres. For the 2013 examination, there were only two available vacancies in the State of Karnataka - one was of 'General Insider' and the other was of 'OBC Outsider'. Applying the Cadre Allocation Policy issued on 10th April 2008 later amended on 21st April 2011 (hereinafter referred to as 'Policy'), the UOI vide notification dated 13.03.2015 (hereinafter referred to as 'impugned notification') 148 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports allocated the 'General Insider' vacancy for State of Karnataka to Respondent No. 3 being General category candidate. On the other hand, Respondent No. 1, who was also having preference for State of Karnataka, allocated the Tamil Nadu cadre, since no SC Insider post was vacant in the State of Karnataka. 10. Challenging the impugned notification, Respondent No. 1 filed the OA before the Tribunal on 26.03.2015 asking to quash the notification in so far as it relates to him and Respondent No. 3 and also sought a consequent direction to UOI and UPSC to allot him the General Insider vacancy in the State of Karnataka with all consequential benefits. The Tribunal, by order dated 15.03.2016 allowed the OA, which was affirmed by the High Court vide impugned order dated 06.08.2019. 11. The High Court was of the view that since Respondent No. 1 had secured a higher rank in Main Examination (Written) compared to Respondent No. 3, and the Preliminary Examination was merely a screening test and marks obtained therein were not to be considered to draw the final merit, therefore, for cadre allocation, the former should be treated as General category candidate and would be entitled to get allocation of Karnataka cadre in General Insider vacancy. Assailing these findings, present appeals have been preferred by UOI and Respondent No. 3. ARGUMENTS OF APPELLANT AND RESPONDENTS 12. Mr. K.M. Nataraj, learned Senior Counsel and Additional Solicitor General of India, with vehemence submitted that the allocation of cadre is governed by the Exam Rules, 2013 and the Policy. Rule 14 of the Exam Rules, 2013 specifically bars the adjustment of reserved category candidates against unreserved vacancies if they have availed relaxation at any stage in eligibility or selection criteria. He put forth emphasis to phrase 'any stage of the examination' and argued that Respondent No. 1 could not secure marks above cut-off for General category in the Preliminary Examination. He had appeared in Main Examination after getting benefit of relaxed standard in SC category, therefore, having availed a relaxation in Preliminary Examination, Respondent No. 1 cannot be a candidate selected on \"General Standards\" required under Paragraph 9 of the Policy read with Rule 14 of the Exam Rules, 2013. To buttress such contentions, reliance has been placed on the judgments of this Court [2026] 1 S.C.R. 149 Union of India v. G. Kiran & Ors. in Deepa E.V. v. Union of India and Ors.1, Gaurav Pradhan v. State of Rajasthan2, Niravkumar Dilipbhai Makwana v. Gujarat Public Service Commission3, Union of India v. Sajib Roy4. 13. Learned Counsel Mr. Vardhman Kaushik, representing the UPSC has supported the submissions made by the Learned Additional Solicitor General of India. Similarly, Learned Senior Counsel, Mr. Nikhil Goel, appearing for the Respondent No. 3, and the Appellant in the connected appeal, has also supported the said contentions and urged that once the benefit of relaxation has been obtained by Respondent No. 1 in the Preliminary Examination, he cannot claim 'General Insider' vacancy at a later stage at the time of cadre allocation, therefore, the decisions of the Tribunal and High Court are liable to be set-aside. 14. Per contra, Learned Senior Counsel Mr. Jayanth Muth Raj appearing for Respondent No. 1 submits that the Preliminary Examination is merely a screening test to shortlist candidates for the Main Examination. Clause 2 of Section I of Appendix I to the Exam Rules, 2013 clearly stipulates that the marks obtained in the Preliminary Examination by the candidates will not be counted for determining the final order of merit. As such the marks obtained by Respondent No. 1 in Preliminary Examination, taking benefit of relaxed standards applicable to SC Candidate cannot be used adversely for the purpose of cadre allocation to him. 15. It is urged, once a candidate performs on merit, surpasses the 'General Standards' and qualifies the Main Examination, securing a higher rank than Respondent No. 3 i.e. General category candidate in the final list, the grant of initial relaxation in Preliminary Examination fades into insignificance. It is said that denial of the General Insider vacancy to a more meritorious candidate on the pretext of relaxation availed in the Preliminary Examination which doesn't even form the basis of final merit list, violates the principles of meritocracy and substantive equality as enshrined under Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India. 1 (2017) 12 SCC 680 2 (2018) 11 SCC 352 3 (2019) 7 SCC 383 4 2025 SCC OnLine SC 1943\n\n150 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports 16. Learned Senior Counsel placed reliance upon the reasoning of the High Court that the term 'General Standards' in Paragraph 9 of the Policy refers to the 'General Qualifying Standard' as contained in Rule 14(i) of Exam Rules, which Respondent No. 1 undisputedly met and surpassed. In support of these contentions, judgements of this court in Jitendra Kumar Singh v. State of UP5, Ajithkumar P. v. Remin K. R.6 and Vikas Sankhala and Others v. Vikas Kumar Agarwal and Others7 has been relied upon and prayed for dismissal of these appeals. APPRECIATION OF ARGUMENTS 17. After having heard learned counsels and upon perusal of the material placed, in our view, the question that falls for our consideration is whether a reserved category candidate who availed relaxation while qualifying Preliminary Examination, though secured more marks than cut-off of the General Category candidate in the Main Examination and Interview for personality test and secured place in the final merit list, can be considered as 'Insider General' candidate for cadre allocation against an unreserved vacancy? 18. In order to adjudicate upon the issue, it is pertinent to refer to the relevant provisions of Rules, 1, 13, 14 and 17 of the Exam Rules, 2013 which are reproduced as hereunder - \"Rule 1. Indian Forest Service Examination will be a two tier (sic) examination - a preliminary screening examination followed by a Main Examination and Interviesw. For screening suitable number of candidates for the 2nd stage of the Examination to be named as Indian Forest Service (Main) Examination, all candidates would be required to qualify Civil Services (Preliminary) Examination (hereinafter called the Preliminary Examination). xxx xxx xxx Rule 13. Candidates who obtain such minimum qualifying marks in the Preliminary Examination as may be fixed by 5 (2010) 3 SCC 119 6 (2015) 16 SCC 778 7 (2017) 1 SCC 350 [2026] 1 S.C.R. 151 Union of India v. G. Kiran & Ors. the Commission at their discretion shall be admitted to the Indian Forest Service (Main) Examination (Written); and candidates who obtain such minimum qualifying marks in the Main Examination (Written) as may be fixed by the Commission at their discretion shall be summoned by them for an interview for a personality test; The minimum qualifying marks as determined above, may be relaxable at the discretion of the Commission, in favour of Physically Handicapped candidates, in order to fill up the vacancies reserved for them, if any. Provided that candidates belonging to the Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes or Other Backward Classes may be summoned for an interview for personality test by the commission by applying relaxed standards in the Preliminary Examination as well as Main Examination (Written) if the Commission is of the opinion that sufficient number of candidates from these communities are not likely to be summoned for interview for a personality test on the basis of the general standard in order to fill up vacancies reserved for them. xxx xxx xxx Rule 14. (i) After interview, the candidates will be arranged by the Commission in the order of merit as disclosed by aggregate marks finally awarded to each candidate in the Main Examination. Thereafter, the commission shall, for the purpose of recommending candidates against unreserved vacancies, fix a qualifying mark (hereinafter referred to as general qualifying standard) with reference to the number of unreserved vacancies to be filled up on the basis of the Main Examination. (ii) The candidates belonging to any of the Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes or Other Backward Classes may to the extent of the number of vacancies reserved for the Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes and the Other Backward Classes be recommended by the Commission by a relaxed standard, subject to the fitness of these candidates for selection to the Service.\n\n152 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports Provided that the candidates belonging to the Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes and the Other Backward Classes who have been recommended by the Commission without resorting to any relaxations/concessions in the eligibility or selection criteria, at any stage of the examination, shall not be adjusted against the vacancies reserved for the Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes. xxx xxx xxx Rule 17. (i) A candidate who qualifies the Preliminary Examination shall be required to indicate the Detailed Application Form his/her choice in the order of preference from amongst the various State Cadres including his/her 'Home State' in case he/she is appointed to the Indian Forest Service. (ii) the cadre allotment to candidates appointed to Indian Forest Service will be governed by the policy of cadre allotment in force at the time of allotment of cadre. Due consideration will be given at the time of making allocation on the results of the examination to the preferences expressed by candidate for various cadres at the time of his/her application.\" 19. After going through Rule 1, it is evident that IFS examination consists of two tiers - tier one is of Preliminary Examination and tier two consists of Main Examination (Written) and Interview. For screening suitable number of candidates for the 2nd stage i.e., Indian Forest Service (Main) Examination, all candidates are required to qualify the Preliminary Examination. 20. Perusal of Rule 13 makes it abundantly clear that after obtaining minimum qualifying marks in Preliminary Examination, the candidate, shall be entitled to appear in the Main Examination (Written). The candidate obtaining minimum qualifying marks in Main Examination may be summoned for Interview for personality test. The determination of the minimum qualifying marks to summon a candidate for an Interview for personality test shall be the discretion of the UPSC. The proviso confers discretion upon UPSC for applying the 'Relaxed Standards' to the candidates belonging to the SC, ST and OBC [2026] 1 S.C.R. 153 Union of India v. G. Kiran & Ors. either in Preliminary or Main Examination (Written) in case sufficient member of these communities are not likely to be summoned applying the 'General Standard' to fill up the vacancies reserved for these categories. 21. As per Rule 14, the candidates who obtain qualifying marks in Main Examination (Written) and are summoned for Interview for personality test shall be arranged in the order of merit as disclosed by the UPSC on the basis of the aggregate of marks scored in Main Examination (Written). After preparation of merit list, the UPSC shall fix qualifying marks for applying 'General Qualifying Standards' for recommending the candidate commensurate to the available unreserved vacancies, to be filled up on the basis of the Main Examination. In this view, Rule 14(i) operates in two parts. First portion deals with preparation of merit list and latter portion deals with preparation of merit list of unreserved category applying the general qualifying standards. Rule 14(ii) applies to the candidates belonging to the SC, ST and OBC to which the UPSC shall make recommendation on basis of 'Relaxed Standard' subject to the fitness of these candidates for selection to the service. The consequence of availing the 'Relaxed Standard' is stipulated in the proviso to Rule 14(ii), whereby it is clear that if a candidate has found place in the merit list without availing 'Relaxed Standards' i.e., without resorting to 'any' 'relaxations' or 'concessions' in eligibility or selection criteria 'at any stage of examination', they shall not be adjusted against the vacancies reserved for SC, ST and OBC. 22. In the above context, the word 'any' is relatable to relaxations or concessions either in 'eligibility' or any 'selection criteria'. It further qualifies that such relaxation/concession can be availed at 'any stage of examination' having relevance to Rule 1 which indicates that all candidates would be required to qualify the Preliminary Examination in order to appear in the Main Examination. Therefore, the proviso throw light by focusing on the issue of relaxations and concessions in eligibility or selection criteria at any stage of examination. At this stage, the point to ponder upon is if a candidate obtains such relaxation or concession in 'eligibility' or 'selection criteria' what would be its effect in the matter of cadre allocation, especially in the facts and circumstances of the case in hand. 23. As per Rule 17 of Exam Rules, 2013, indeed it is correct to say that only after qualifying the Preliminary Examination the candidate 154 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports does have a choice to submit the preference for various state cadres including home state for appointment to the IFS. It is further true that the State Cadre allotment to the IFS will be governed by the policy in force at the time of allotment of cadre. In the said context the policy dated 10th April 2008 amended on 21st April 2011 governing the cadre allocation of the relevant time assumes significance. Para 9 of the Policy is relevant, therefore, reproduced as thus: - \"9. Notwithstanding what has been said above a reserved category candidate selected on general standards shall be eligible for allocation against the available un-reserved vacancy as per his merit and preference. But if he cannot be allocated against such vacancy, for he is lower in rank compared with other general category candidates, he shall be considered for allocation as per his merit and preference against the available vacancy of his category.\" 24. Upon conjoint reading of the Rules quoted above in juxtaposition to Clause 9 of the Policy, it is clear that a reserved category candidate selected applying 'General Standard' has eligibility for allocation on unreserved vacancy as per his merit and preference if he is not lower in rank from other General category candidates, otherwise he shall be considered for allocation as per his merit and preference against the available vacancy of his category. In the said context, it is clear that for allocation of unreserved vacancy to a candidate of reserved category, the selection must be on 'General Standard' without availing any 'Relaxed Standard' in either eligibility or selection criteria. In case any 'Relaxed Standard' has been availed by him, his allocation of cadre would be as per his merit and preference against vacancy of his category. 25. After analyzing the Exam Rules, 2013 and the Policy, we find ourselves at variance with the findings recorded in the Impugned Order. While dismissing the Writ Petition and affirming the order of the Tribunal, the thrust of reasoning of the High Court was that 'General Standards' as used in Paragraph 9 of Policy can only mean to be 'General Qualifying Standard' as appearing in Rule 14(i) of Exam Rules, 2013 i.e. qualifying marks fixed by UPSC with reference to number of unreserved vacancies to be filled up on the basis of the Main Examination. In other words, the High Court effectively read Paragraph 9 of the Policy to mean that if a reserved category candidate\n\n[2026] 1 S.C.R. 155 Union of India v. G. Kiran & Ors. selected acquiring the position in the merit of unreserved category list obtaining 'qualifying marks fixed by UPSC with reference to number of unreserved vacancies on the basis of the Main Examination' shall be eligible for allocation against available unreserved vacancies. It was also observed that the purpose behind providing relaxation in the nature of age, number of attempts, payment of fees and such other eligibility criteria in favour of candidates belonging to reserved category is to ensure a level playing field and that real merit is tested in the Main Examination (Written) where the mettle of the candidates is put to test. Hence, if the candidates belonging to the reserved category score better than a general merit candidate in the tier two examination, such candidate cannot be denied cadre allocation in open category insider cadre vacancy. 26. We are unable to subscribe to and confirm the view taken by the High Court. In our view, the High Court lost sight of the mandate of Rule 1 which clearly prescribes that IFS Examination consists of two tiers - first tier is Preliminary Examination followed by tier two involving Main Exam (Written) and Interview. Only those candidates who are found suitable in the first tier may avail entry for the tier two. All the candidates are required to qualify Preliminary Examination for participation in further selection process by way of Main Examination (Written) and Interview. Rule 13 and its proviso contemplate that only those candidates who obtain minimum qualifying marks as prescribed on discretion by UPSC in the Preliminary Examination shall be admitted to the Main Examination (Written) and all those candidates who obtain minimum qualifying marks as prescribed by UPSC in the Main Examination (Written) shall be called upon for an Interview for a personality test. The proviso to the said rule provides for applying relaxed standards in Preliminary as well as the Main Examination (Written) to SC, ST and OBC candidates for the purpose of summoning them for interview if such candidate does not come within the general standards in order to fill up the vacancies of reserved category and to facilitate due representation. 27. Further, Rule 14(i) deals with preparation of merit list after a written and interview for personality test. Thereafter, it deals with recommending the candidates against unreserved vacancies applying general standards with reference to number of unreserved vacancies. Rule 14(ii) deals with the situation for the candidates of SC, ST and OBC where discretion has been conferred upon UPSC to grant 156 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports relaxed standards to the fittest of these candidates for selection to the service. While dealing with those relaxed standards, it has been made clear in proviso that the candidates of SC, ST and OBC recommended without resorting to 'any', 'relaxation' or 'concession' in 'eligibility' or 'selection criteria' at 'any stage of examination' may be adjusted against the vacancies of unreserved category. The natural corollary to the above makes it clear those reserved category candidates who have availed of any relaxation or concession at 'any stage of the examination' are not eligible to be adjusted against unreserved vacancies. 28. On appreciation of the rules referred above, it is clear that any relaxation or concession in eligibility or in selection criteria, if taken at any stage of examination by such candidate of SC, ST and OBC, they may not get any benefit to claim the vacancy of unreserved category, in particular, in the context of Rule 17(1) of the Exam Rule, 2013 seeking allocation of General Insider vacancy in home State cadre as it would be contrary to paragraph 9 of the Policy. 29. It is relevant to emphasis that Rule 1 clearly stipulates that IFS examination involves two tiers. Without qualifying first tier i.e., Preliminary Examination, a candidate may not be in a position to participate in Main Examination (Written). Therefore, even though the Preliminary Examination is merely a screening test and marks obtained may not be counted for determining final merit as per Clause 2 of Section I of Appendix-I of Exam Rules, 2013, nonetheless, it is an integral stage of the examination and relaxation availed by any candidate even at the stage of Preliminary Examination cannot escape the phraseology of proviso to Rule 14(ii) i.e., 'relaxed standard' granted at 'any stage of examination'. 30. At this juncture, we can profitably refer to the judgment of this Court in Deepa E.V. (Supra). In the said case, the appellant, who was an OBC category candidate, sought appointment on general unreserved vacancy on the ground that the marks obtained by her was over and above the minimum cut-off marks prescribed for general category candidates. While considering a similar provisions as per O.M. of Department of Personnel and Training dated 01.07.1998, it was held that when a candidate avails age relaxation, he is not entitled to be adjusted against the unreserved category. The relevant paragraph is reproduced as thus - [2026] 1 S.C.R. 157 Union of India v. G. Kiran & Ors. \"7. On a combined reading of Rule 9 of the Export Inspection Agency (Recruitment) Rules, 1980 and also the proceedings dated 1-7-1998, we find that there is an express bar for the candidates belonging to SC/ST/ OBC who have availed relaxation for being considered for general category candidates.\" The logic applied in above case applies with equal force to relaxation in qualifying marks at the preliminary stage as it has happened in the present appeals. 31. We also find merit in the reliance placed by the Appellant on the decision in Gaurav Pradhan (Supra). In that case, the post in question was of Police Constables and Sub-Inspectors of Police and the recruitment process was of the year 2010. Vide an earlier circular dated 24.06.2008, it was provided that the members of SC/ST/ OBC can compete against non-reserved vacancies and be counted against them, in case they have not taken any concession (like that of age, etc.) available to them other than that relating to payment of examination fees in case of direct recruitment. Thereafter, vide a circular dated 11.05.2011, without superseding earlier circular of 2008, it was provided that if a candidate belonging to BC/SBC/SC/ ST, irrespective of whether they have availed of or not any of the special concession which are available to them, secures more marks than the marks obtained by last unreserved category candidate who is selected, such a candidate belonging to aforementioned categories shall be counted against unreserved category vacancies and not reserved vacancies. On filing writ petitions before High Court by various general category candidates, the learned Single Judge dismissed the same which came to be confirmed with certain modifications by the Division Bench. While allowing the appeals, this Court observed thus: \"33. In a recent judgment, this Court has occasion to consider the judgment of this Court in Jitendra Kumar Singh case [Jitendra Kumar Singh v. State of U.P., (2010) 3 SCC 119 : (2010) 1 SCC (L&S) 772] . The learned counsel for the appellants has placed much reliance on the judgment of this Court dated 6-4-2017 in Deepa E.V. v. Union of India [Deepa E.V. v. Union of India, (2017) 12 SCC 680 : (2018) 1 SCC (L&S) 100] . It is necessary to notice the facts of the 158 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports case and the issues decided by this Court in Deepa E.V. [Deepa E.V. v. Union of India, (2017) 12 SCC 680 : (2018) 1 SCC (L&S) 100] The appellant before this Court was an OBC category candidate who claimed that she should be treated as general category candidate. The appellant had availed the age relaxation as OBC category candidate. A writ petition was filed by the appellant claiming that she should be treated as candidate in general category. The learned Single Judge dismissed the writ petition by the judgment dated 16-1-2015 [Deepa E.V. v. Union of India, 2015 SCC OnLine Ker 2470] which judgment was affirmed [Deepa E.V. v. Union of India, 2015 SCC OnLine Ker 21264] by the Division Bench in the writ appeal. In para 2 of the judgment, facts were noted to the following effect: (Deepa E.V. case [Deepa E.V. v. Union of India, (2017) 12 SCC 680 : (2018) 1 SCC (L&S) 100] , SCC p. 681) \"2. The appellant applied for the post of Laboratory Assistant Grade II in Export Inspection Council of India functioning under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India. The appellant belongs to Dheevara community which is one of the \"Other Backward Class\". Since the appellant was aged 26 years, she got age relaxation, as was granted to OBC category candidates. The appellant was one of the eleven candidates from OBC who were called for interview. The appellant secured 82 marks (in the list of candidates from OBC category). One Ms Serena Joseph (OBC), who secured 93 marks was selected and appointed.\" xxx xxx xxx 37. The judgment of this Court in Deepa E.V. [Deepa E.V. v. Union of India, (2017) 12 SCC 680 : (2018) 1 SCC (L&S) 100] fully supports the case of the appellants. In Deepa E.V. case [Deepa E.V. v. Union of India, (2017) 12 SCC 680 : (2018) 1 SCC (L&S) 100] also the Circular of the Central Government dated 1-7-1998/2-7-1997 provided the relevant provision which is to the following effect: (SCC pp. 682-83, para 6)\n\n[2026] 1 S.C.R. 159 Union of India v. G. Kiran & Ors. \"6. … '… In other words, when a relaxed standard is applied in selecting SC/ST/OBC candidates, for example in the age-limit, experience, qualification, permitted number of chances in written examination, extended zone of consideration larger than what is provided for general category candidates, etc., the SC/ST/OBC candidates are to be counted against reserved vacancies. Such candidates would be deemed as unavailable for consideration against unreserved vacancies.' \" (emphasis in original) xxx xxx xxx 46. The Division Bench [Rajesh Singh v. State of Rajasthan, 2014 SCC OnLine Raj 6470 : (2014) 2 RLW 1585] as well as the learned counsel appearing for the State of Rajasthan has relied on the Circular dated 11-5-2011. The Division Bench has observed that the Circular dated 11-5-2011 did not change the rules of game. The following observation has been made with regard to the Circular dated 11-5-2011: (Rajesh Singh case [Rajesh Singh v. State of Rajasthan, 2014 SCC OnLine Raj 6470 : (2014) 2 RLW 1585] , SCC OnLine Raj para 57) \"57. In the instant case, the State Government in supersession of its earlier policy decision regarding treatment to be given to the candidates belonging to reserved category who are selected against unreserved category vacancies, issued directives for guidance to the appointing authorities vide the Circular dated 11-5-2011 that neither changed the eligibility criteria seeking employment nor manner and method of selection of suitable candidates and in our considered view, the Circular dated 11-5-2011 did not change rules of the game after the game is played or process of selection is initiated as observed by the learned Single Judge [Madan Lal v. State of Rajasthan, 2012 SCC OnLine Raj 1182] , [Manish Sharma v. State of Rajasthan, 2013 SCC OnLine 160 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports Raj 4100] but such policy decisions are always within realm of judicial review and this is what the Court considered and examined policy decision of the Government impugned.\" xxx xxx xxx 49. In view of the foregoing discussion, we are of the considered opinion that the candidates belonging to SC/ST/BC, who had taken relaxation of age, were not entitled to be migrated to the unreserved vacancies; the State of Rajasthan has migrated such candidates who have taken concession of age against the unreserved vacancies which resulted displacement of a large number of candidates who were entitled to be selected against the unreserved category vacancies. The candidates belonging to unreserved category who could not be appointed due to migration of candidates belonging to SC/ST/BC were clearly entitled for appointment which was denied to them on the basis of the above illegal interpretation put by the State. We, however, also take notice of the fact that the reserved category candidates who had taken benefit of age relaxation and were migrated on the unreserved category candidates, are working for more than last five years. The reserved category candidates who were appointed on migration against unreserved vacancies are not at fault in any manner. Hence, we are of the opinion that SC/ST/ BC candidates who have been so migrated in reserved vacancies and appointed, should not be displaced and allowed to continue in respective posts. On the other hand, the unreserved candidates who could not be appointed due to the above illegal migration are also entitled for appointment as per their merit. The equities have to be adjusted by this Court.\" (emphasis supplied) In the said case, this Court while affirming the view taken in Deepa E.V. (Supra), held that reserved category candidates who had availed corresponding relaxations, could not be considered on general/ unreserved vacancies.\n\n[2026] 1 S.C.R. 161 Union of India v. G. Kiran & Ors. 32. Similarly, this court in Niravkumar Dilipbhai (Supra) while considering an identical factual situation involving a circular barring consideration of reserved category candidates on unreserved posts observed as under - \"22. Article 16(4) of the Constitution is an enabling provision empowering the State to make any provision or reservation of appointments or posts in favour of any backward class of citizens which in the opinion of the State is not adequately represented in the service under the State. It is purely a matter of discretion of the State Government to formulate a policy for concession, exemption, preference or relaxation either conditionally or unconditionally in favour of the backward classes of citizens. The reservation being the enabling provision, the manner and the extent to which reservation is provided has to be spelled out from the orders issued by the Government from time to time. xxx xxx xxx 23. In the instant case, the State Government has framed policy for the grant of reservation in favour of SC/ST and OBC by the Circulars dated 21-1-2000 and 23-7-2004. The State Government has clarified that when a relaxed standard is applied in selecting a candidate for SC/ST, SEBC category in the age-limit, experience, qualification, permitting number of chances in the written examination, etc., then candidate of such category selected in the said manner, shall have to be considered only against his/her reserved post. Such a candidate would be deemed as unavailable for consideration against unreserved post. xxx xxx xxx 34. There is also no merit in the submission of the learned counsel for the appellant that relaxation in age at the initial qualifying stage would not fall foul of the Circulars dated 29-1-2000 and 23-7-2004. The distinction sought to be drawn between the preliminary and final examination is totally misconceived. It is evident from the advertisement that a person who avails of an age relaxation at the initial stage will necessarily avail of the same relaxation even at 162 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports the final stage. We are of the view that the age relaxation granted to the candidates belonging to SC/ST and SEBC category in the instant case is an incident of reservation under Article 16(4) of the Constitution of India.\" (emphasis supplied) The Court affirming the proposition of law stated that once relaxation has been taken by a reserved category candidate, they cannot be considered for unreserved vacancies. Inescapably, the aforesaid judgement also strengthens the view taken by us hereinabove interpreting the rules that if a reserved category candidate takes benefit of relaxation though at initial stage, it will effectively amount to taking relaxation even at the final stage of the selection process because without giving relaxation to him, he was not in a position to participate in the Main examination and to set forth his claim of cadre allocation. 33. Very recently in Sajib Roy (Supra), this court had the occasion to deal with a similar factual matrix as observed hereunder- \"32. On an analysis of the aforecited cases, we summarise as follows: Whether a reserved candidate who has availed relaxation in fees/upper age limit to participate in open competition with general candidates may be recruited against unreserved seats would depend on the facts of each case. That is to say, in the event there is no embargo in the recruitment rules/employment notification, such reserved candidates who have scored higher than the last selected unreserved candidate shall be entitled to migrate and be recruited against unreserved seats. However, if an embargo is imposed under relevant recruitment rules, such reserved candidates shall not be permitted to migrate to general category seats. xxx xxx xxx 33. Accordingly, we hold as the respondents-writ petitioners had availed concession of age for participating in the recruitment process, in the teeth of office memorandum dated 01.07.1998, the High Court was wrong in applying the ratio in Jitendra Kumar (supra) and permitting them to\n\n[2026] 1 S.C.R. 163 Union of India v. G. Kiran & Ors. be considered for appointment in the unreserved category. Consequently, we set aside the common impugned judgment and order dated 12.10.2018 and order dated 26.02.2019 and allow the appeals. Pending application(s) if any, stand disposed of.\" 34. At this stage, pertinently the judgements relied upon by the learned senior counsel for Respondent No. 1 in their support are necessarily required to be appreciated. In Jitendra Kumar Singh (Supra), this court while considering whether an OBC candidate who applied exercising his option as a reserved category candidate, would be eligible to be considered against an unreserved vacancy, if he secures more marks than the last candidate in general category. Nonetheless, in the said case, this court was considering the issue in reference to instructions issued by the State of Uttar Pradesh dated 25.03.1994 which specifically provided for migration of reserved category candidates to unreserved vacancies despite they having availed any facility or relaxation (like relaxation in age limit) available to reserved category. Therefore, it is distinguishable on facts of the present appeals. 35. In Ajithkumar P. (Supra), this Court was considering a factual situation wherein the reserved category candidate had availed relaxation in the preliminary examination, however, found that the said Preliminary Examination was not having any statutory basis. Therefore, this judgement is also distinguishable on facts and will not come to rescue to the case of Respondent No. 1. As far as Vikas Sankhala (Supra) is concerned, it involved recruitment to the post of teachers whereby relaxation in minimum pass marks in Teachers Eligibility Test to reserved category candidates was granted by state government in following manner - a. 10% to persons belonging to SC/ST/OBC/SBC/General- Women b. 15% to all women of SC/ST/OBC/SBC and widowed / divorced women c. 20% to persons covered under PwD Various candidates belonging to general category candidates came before this Court in Appeal on the ground that minimum qualifying marks with respect to TET was 60% and any relaxation thereto meant availing relaxation pursuant to reservation and thus, migration 164 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports of such candidates who took benefit of above indicated relaxations to the unreserved/general vacancies was impermissible. The said appeals were allowed with following observations - \"80. Having regard to the respective submissions noted above, first aspect that needs consideration is as to whether relaxation in TET pass marks would amount to concession in the recruitment process. The High Court has held to be so on the premise that Para 9(a) dealing with such relaxation in TET marks forms part of the document which relates to the recruitment procedure. It is difficult to accept this rationale or analogy. Passing of TET examination is a condition of eligibility for appointment as a teacher. It is a necessary qualification without which a candidate is not eligible to be considered for appointment. This was clearly mentioned in the Guidelines/Notification dated 11-2-2011. These Guidelines pertain to conducting of TET; basic features whereof have already been pointed out above. Even Para 9 which provides for concessions that can be given to certain reserved categories deals with \"qualifying marks\" that is to be obtained in TET examination. Thus, a person who passes TET examination becomes eligible to participate in the selection process as and when such selection process for filling up of the posts of primary teachers is to be undertaken by the State. On the other hand, when it comes to recruitment of teachers, the method for appointment of teachers is altogether different. Here, merit list of successful candidates is to be prepared on the basis of marks obtained under different heads. One of the heads is \"marks in TET\". So far as this head is concerned, 20% of the marks obtained in TET are to be assigned to each candidate. Therefore, those reserved category candidates who secured lesser marks in TET would naturally get less marks under this head. We would like to demonstrate it with an example: Suppose a reserved category candidate obtains 53 marks in TET, he is treated as having qualified TET. However, when he is considered for selection to the post of primary teacher, in respect of allocation of marks he will get 20% marks for TET. As against him, a general candidate who secures 70 marks in TET shall be awarded\n\n[2026] 1 S.C.R. 165 Union of India v. G. Kiran & Ors. 14 marks in recruitment process. Thus, on the basis of TET marks reserved category candidate has not got any advantage while considering his candidature for the post. On the contrary, \"level-playing field\" is maintained whereby a person securing higher marks in TET, whether belonging to general category or reserved category, is allocated higher marks in respect of 20% of TET marks. Thus, in recruitment process no weightage or concession is given and allocation of 20% of TET marks is applied across the board. Therefore, the High Court is not correct in observing that concession was given in the recruitment process on the basis of relaxation in TET.\" (emphasis supplied) Therefore, it is clear that the relaxations in TET marks were not considered to be a concession. For this reason, the said judgement is also distinguishable. 36. In the facts of the present case, the General category cut-off for the Preliminary Examination was fixed at 267. Respondent No. 1 secured 247.18 marks. Had the Respondent No. 1 been put against the general standard, his candidature would have been terminated at the first stage i.e., the Preliminary Examination. His candidature succeeded in the first stage of the examination because of the relaxed standards allowed in the Preliminary Examination for SC candidates i.e. 233 marks. After availing the benefit of this relaxation for admission to the Main Examination, Respondent No. 1 cannot subsequently claim to have been selected on \"General Standard\" merely due to his performance in the subsequent stages surpassed the general standard. Therefore, if a candidate who has resorted a relaxation at any stage of examination, would not fall within the purview of the proviso to Rule 14(ii) of the Exam Rules, 2013 and in that situation, for the purpose of the applicable Policy for cadre allocation, he would not fall within the list of candidates selected on 'General Standard' claiming General Insider vacancy of home state cadre as insider candidate.. 37. In light of the above exposition of law, we are of the opinion that in the present fact situation, the 'General Insider' vacancy in Karnataka was rightfully allocated to Respondent No. 3, who qualified the Preliminary Examination, Main Examination, and Interview on general standard. It is needless to say, Respondent No. 1, having qualified 166 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports the Preliminary Examination availing 'relaxed standard', becoming eligible for the Main Examination must be considered against the reserved vacancies only and cannot be considered on general/ unreserved vacancies for the purpose of cadre allocation. 38. In our view, the High Court while affirming the judgment of the Tribunal has glossed over Rule 1, intent of Rule 13 and intent of proviso to Rule 13 as well as the real meaning of Rule 14 and proviso thereto along with paragraph 9 of Policy. Therefore, the judgments of the Tribunal and the High Court deserve to be set aside. CONCLUSION 39. In view of the foregoing, we hold that the Tribunal and the High Court were not correct in interpreting the relevant provisions of Exam Rules, 2013 and Paragraph 9 of the Policy and committed mistake in granting the relief to Respondent No. 1. We hold that Respondent No. 1, having availed the benefit of \"Relaxed Standard\" in the Preliminary Examination, cannot be treated as a candidate selected on \"General Standard\". Consequently, he is not entitled to be allocated against the \"General Insider\" vacancy in the Karnataka Cadre in place of Respondent No.3. 40. Accordingly, the appeals are allowed.

Case Arising From CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Criminal Appeal No. 74 of 2026 From the Judgment and Order dated 08.07.2019 of the High Court of Delhi at New Delhi in CRLR No. 1 of 2014 Appearances for Parties R. Basant, Sr. Adv./A.C. Advs. for the Appellant(s): Mrs. Aishwarya Bhati, A.S.G., Mukesh Kumar Maroria, Ms. Rekha Pandey, Ms. Priyanka Das, Ms. Vishakha, Ms. Chitrangda Rashtravara, Ms. Shreya Jain.\n\n170 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports Judgment / Order of the Supreme Court Judgment Sanjay Kumar, J. 1. Leave granted. 2. The State (NCT) of Delhi is aggrieved by the judgment dated 08.07.2019, whereby a Division Bench of the High Court of Delhi answered Criminal Reference No. 1 of 2014. By the said reference, the learned Additional District & Sessions Judge - II, North-West District, Rohini Courts, Delhi1, had referred three questions of law to the High Court of Delhi for its decision, under Section 395(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 19732. The questions read as under: - 'a. Whether in a case of inducement, allurement and cheating of large number of investors/depositors in pursuance to a criminal conspiracy, each deposit by an investor constitutes a separate and individual transaction or all such transactions can be amalgamated and clubbed into a single FIR by showing one investor as complainant and others as witnesses? b. If in case the Hon'ble Court concludes that each deposit has to be treated as separate transaction, then how many such transactions can be amalgamated into one charge sheet? (Note: - As per the provisions of Section 219 CrPC and as observed by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Narinderjit Singh Sahni & anr. vs. Union of India & ors., only three transactions in a particular year can be clubbed in a single charge sheet). c. Whether under the given circumstances the concept of maximum punishment of seven years for a single offence can be pressed into service by the accused by clubbing 1 For short, 'Additional Sessions Judge' 2 For short, 'CrPC' [2026] 1 S.C.R. 171 The State (NCT) of Delhi v. Khimji Bhai Jadeja and amalgamating all the transactions into one FIR with maximum punishment of seven years? (Note: - If this is done, this would be in violation of concept of Proportionality of Punishment as provided in the Code of Criminal Procedure. In the case of Narinderjit Singh Sahni vs. Union of India & ors., it has been observed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court that this cannot be done but in case if we go by the ratio laid down by the Delhi High Court in the case of State vs. Ramesh Chand Kapoor this is possible. Hence, this aspect requires an authoritative pronouncement by a larger Bench).' 3. The Division Bench answered the questions as follows: - '…. Thus, our answer to Question (a) is that in a case of inducement, allurement and cheating of large number of investors/depositors in pursuance to a criminal conspiracy, each deposit by an investor constitutes a separate and individual transaction. All such transactions cannot be amalgamated and clubbed into a single FIR by showing one investor as the complainant and others as witnesses. In respect of each such transaction, it is imperative for the State to register a separate FIR if the complainant discloses commission of a cognizable offence. …. Thus, our answer to question (b) is that in respect of each FIR, a separate final report (and wherever necessary supplementary/further charge sheet(s)) have to be filed, and there is no question of amalgamation of the final reports that may be filed in respect of different FIRs. The amalgamation, strictly in terms of Section 219 Cr.P.C., would be considered by the Court/ Magistrate at the stage of framing of charge, since Section 219(1) mandates that where the requirements set out in the said Section are met, the accused \"may be charged with, and tried at one trial for, any number of them not exceeding three\". …. In our view, the aforesaid question [sic, (c)] does not survive in view of the answer to question (a) and (b). It would be for the Trial Court to consider the sentence to which the convict may be subjected as per law, keeping\n\n172 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports in view the well settled principles of sentencing. In this regard, we may only refer to Section 31 of the Cr.P.C. which, inter alia, provides that when a person is convicted at one trial of two or more offences, the Court, may subject to the provisions of Section 71 IPC, sentence him for such offences to the several punishments prescribed therefore which such Court is competent to inflict. It further provides that such punishments, which consist of imprisonment, would commence one after the expiration of the other, unless the Court directs that such punishments shall run concurrently. The limitation on the quantum of sentence is prescribed by sub-section 2 of Section 31 of the Cr.P.C., but the same would apply in respect of convictions at one trial of two or more offences. However, where the trials are multiple, which result into multiple convictions, the proviso to Section 31 (2) would have no application.' 4. The State filed the present appeal assailing these answers. By order dated 25.11.2019, this Court stayed the operation of the impugned judgment. Mr. R. Basant, learned senior counsel, was requested to assist the Court as an amicus curiae. Despite service of notice, Khimji Bhai Jadeja, the respondent, did not enter appearance before this Court. 5. The reference by the learned Additional Sessions Judge arose in the context of FIR No. 89 of 2009 registered on 01.06.2009 by the Economic Offences Wing of the Delhi Police under Sections 420 and 120B of the Indian Penal Code, 18603, at the behest of one Rajesh Kumar. His complaint was that Ashok Jadeja and his accomplices, one of whom was Khimji Bhai Jadeja, the respondent herein, had falsely represented that Ashok Jadeja was blessed with the divine power of Sikotar Mata to triple money in a few days. A large number of people were stated to have been induced to invest their monies and were ultimately duped. During the investigation into this complaint, it was found that altogether 1,852 victims had been cheated of their monies, to the tune of ₹46.40 crores. The other 1851 complaints were clubbed with FIR No. 89 of 2009 and those complainants were made witnesses by treating their complaints as statements. 3 For short, 'IPC' [2026] 1 S.C.R. 173 The State (NCT) of Delhi v. Khimji Bhai Jadeja On 09.02.2014, the Delhi Police filed a charge sheet against 15 persons. Six more supplementary charge sheets came to be filed between 2014 and 2025. Meanwhile, when Khimji Bhai Jadeja, the respondent herein, filed a petition in 2014 seeking bail, the learned Additional Sessions Judge framed the aforestated three questions of law, vide order dated 14.03.2014, and referred them to the High Court for appropriate decision under Section 395(2) CrPC, leading to that reference being answered by way of the impugned judgment. 6. The Division Bench of the High Court was of the opinion that registering a single FIR and treating the other complainants as witnesses would result in deprivation of the rights of such complainants to pursue their individual complaints. The Bench conceded that they could, at the most, be treated as witnesses to establish the criminal conspiracy, but treating them only as witnesses would deprive them of the right to file protest petitions in the event a closure report was filed by the police in the sole FIR that was registered or if the Magistrate concerned did not accept the final report and discharged the accused. It was on this basis that the Division Bench answered question (a) by concluding that such complaints could not be amalgamated into one FIR by treating all such complainants as witnesses therein. Apropos question (b), the Bench opined that the police could not club separate offences investigated under separate FIRs into one final report and that a separate final report had to be filed in relation to each FIR. Referring to Section 219 CrPC, the Bench opined that amalgamation thereunder could be considered by the Magistrate concerned at the stage of framing of charges, upto a maximum of three. As regards question (c), the Bench opined that it would be for the Trial Court to consider the sentence that could be imposed on a convicted accused in accordance with the well-settled principles of sentencing and the legal provisions relevant thereto. 7. The learned Additional Solicitor General, appearing for the appellant- State, would contend that a conspiracy to procure deposits from several persons so as to dupe them would be a 'single transaction', irrespective of the number of people defrauded and each such transaction ought not to be treated as a separate offence, requiring an individual FIR to be registered therefor. She would argue that clubbing of FIRs is permissible in law and that requiring individual FIRs to be registered in a case of this nature would be cumbersome and wholly unnecessary. She would point out that the statute 174 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports provides for charges being consolidated against multiple persons for multiple offences, if such offences form part of the same transaction. Reliance is placed upon State of Andhra Pradesh vs. Cheemalapati Ganeswara Rao and another4, wherein this Court observed thus: \"where several acts committed by a person show a unity of purpose or design, that would be a strong circumstance to indicate that those acts form part of the same transaction.\" She would argue that the acts of the accused persons in the case on hand also constitute a 'single transaction', justifying the clubbing of all the complaints with the first FIR. Lastly, she would assert that requiring registration of individual FIRs for each such complaint would lead to multiplicity of proceedings, which would be violative of public policy, and would also increase the burden upon the prosecution as well as the judiciary. 8. Mr. R. Basant, learned amicus curiae, made detailed submissions on all aspects of the matter. He would state that the reference itself was premature, as the investigation was still pending and the police were yet to determine whether all the alleged acts of cheating were part of the same transaction, falling within the ambit of Section 220(1) CrPC and Section 223(a) and (d) CrPC. He would further state that, perusal of the allegations in FIR No. 89 of 2009 manifests that a single conspiracy was alleged and, therefore, the course adopted by the Delhi Police in registering one single FIR was appropriate. He would point out that even if multiple FIRs had been registered, consolidation of such FIRs is permissible in law, as was pointed out by this Court time and again. He would submit that no exception could be taken to the registration of one FIR and treating the complaints of the other victims as part of the investigation in the said FIR. Referring to the charge sheets filed by the Delhi Police in the present case, the learned amicus would point out that general allegations were made therein that a criminal conspiracy was hatched, thereby attracting Section 120B IPC. In summation, he would submit that the answers by the Division Bench of the High Court to questions (a) and (b) are incorrect. He would assert that, as to whether consolidation of charges can be effected or not is a question that would arise for consideration only at the stage of framing of charges and if the alleged offences formed part of the same transaction, whatever be the number of complainants, such consolidation is permissible under 4 [1964] 3 SCR 297 : AIR 1963 SC 1850 [2026] 1 S.C.R. 175 The State (NCT) of Delhi v. Khimji Bhai Jadeja the provisions of the statute and, if not, separate charges would have to be framed, subject to Section 219 CrPC. 9. The issue, therefore, boils down to whether or not the offences allegedly committed against the 1,852 complainants were part of the 'same transaction'. We may first note the case law that has developed over time on the issue of consolidation of FIRs. In S. Swamirathnam vs. State of Madras5, a 3-Judge Bench of this Court rejected the contention of the accused that there was misjoinder of charges as several conspiracies, distinct from each other, had been lumped together and tried at one trial. The Bench observed that the charges, as framed, disclosed one single conspiracy spread over several years and the only object of the conspiracy was to cheat members of the public. Per the Bench, the mere fact that others joined in the conspiracy in the course of those years or the fact that several incidents of cheating took place pursuant to the conspiracy did not change the conspiracy or split it up into several conspiracies. It was held that the instances of cheating were in pursuance of one conspiracy and were, therefore, parts of the same transaction. 10. In Banwarilal Jhunjhunwala and others vs. Union of India and another6, this Court dealt with the question as to what is meant by 'every distinct offence'. It was held that 'distinct' meant 'not identical' and two offences would be distinct if they are not, in any way, inter- related. It was further held that if there is some inter-relation, there would be no distinctness and it would depend upon the circumstances of the case in which the offences were committed whether there be separate charges for those offences or not. 11. In Cheemalapati Ganeswara Rao (supra), a 3-Judge Bench of this Court observed that, what is to be ascertained under Section 235(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (equivalent to Section 218(1) CrPC), was whether the offences arise out of acts so connected together as to form the same transaction. It was noted that 'same transaction' is not defined anywhere in the 1898 Code and it was held that whether transactions can be regarded as the same transaction would necessarily depend upon the particular facts of each case. The Bench noted that the general thought is that, 5 (1956) 2 SCC 144 : AIR 1957 SC 340 6 [1963] Supp. 2 SCR 338 : AIR 1963 SC 1620 176 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports where there is proximity of time or place or unity of purpose and design or continuity of action in respect of a series of acts, it may be possible to infer that they form part of the same transaction. The Bench, however, cautioned that it is not necessary that every one of these elements should co-exist for transactions to be regarded as the same transaction and elaborated that if several acts committed by a person show a unity of purpose or design, then it may be a strong circumstance to indicate that those acts form part of the same transaction. Noting that a transaction may consist of an isolated act or a series of acts, the Bench held that such series of acts must, of necessity, be connected with one another and if some of them stand out independently, they would not form part of the same transaction but would constitute a different transaction. It was concluded that the 'same transaction' means a transaction consisting either of a single act or of a series of connected acts. 12. In State of Jharkhand through SP, Central Bureau of Investigation vs. Lalu Prasad Yadav alias Lalu Prasad7, this Court observed that even if the modus operandi is the same, it would not make it a single offence when the offences are separate. This Court held that, if a conspiracy is furthered into several distinct offences, there have to be separate trials. Illustrating the point, it was observed there may be a situation where, in furtherance of a general conspiracy, offences take place in different parts of the country, leading to several persons being killed at different times and, in such a situation, each trial would have to be held separately so that the accused are punished separately for each offence committed in furtherance of the conspiracy. It was pointed out if there is only one trial for such a conspiracy, in spite of separate offences being committed, it would enable the accused to go scot-free, despite committing a number of offences, which is not the intendment of law. 13. In Amish Devgan vs. Union of India and others8, seven FIRs came to be registered in the States of Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh in relation to a television telecast, which formed the basis for the offences alleged. Applying the law laid down in T.T. 7 (2017) 8 SCC 1 8 (2021) 1 SCC 1 [2026] 1 S.C.R. 177 The State (NCT) of Delhi v. Khimji Bhai Jadeja Antony vs. State of Kerala and others9, which was followed thereafter in Arnab Ranjan Goswami vs. Union of India and others10, this Court directed the clubbing of the FIRs. It was observed that, when the subject matter of the FIRs is the same incident or occurrence or is in regard to incidents, which are two or more parts of the same transaction, then a separate and second FIR need not be proceeded with. It was observed that, in terms of the law laid down in T.T. Antony (supra), the subsequent FIRs would be treated as statements under Section 161 CrPC. It was held that it would be open to the other complainants to file protest petitions in case a closure report was filed by the police. It was observed that upon filing of such protest petitions, the Magistrate is obliged to consider the contentions urged; even reject the closure report and take cognizance of the offence as, otherwise, such complainants would face difficulty in contesting the closure report, even if there is enough material to make out a case of commission of the offence. 14. In Abhishek Singh Chauhan vs. Union of India and others11, this Court again followed the exposition in Amish Devgan (supra) and deemed it appropriate to exercise power under Article 142 of the Constitution to direct clubbing of all the FIRs in different States so that they could proceed together to a single trial, as far as possible. This measure was adopted with the consent of all the concerned States. 15. In T.T. Antony (supra), this Court observed that there can be no second FIR in relation to the same cognizable offence and, consequently, there can be no fresh investigation on receipt of every subsequent information in respect of the same cognizable offence or same occurrence or incident, giving rise to one or more cognizable offences. It was observed that, on receipt of information about a cognizable offence or any incident giving rise to a cognizable offence or offences and on entering the FIR in the Station House Diary, the officer in charge of the police station has to investigate not merely the cognizable offence reported in the FIR, but also any other connected offences that may be found to have been committed. In this regard, it was specifically observed as under: 9 (2001) 6 SCC 181 10 (2020) 14 SCC 12 11 2022 SCC OnLine SC 1936 178 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports '18. …….. All other information made orally or in writing after the commencement of the investigation into the cognizable offence disclosed from the facts mentioned in the first information report and entered in the station house diary by the police officer or such other cognizable offence as may come to his notice during the investigation, will be statements falling under Section 162 CrPC. No such information/statement can properly be treated as an FIR and entered in the station house diary again, as it would in effect be a second FIR and the same cannot be in conformity with the scheme of CrPC.' 16. In Amanat Ali vs. State of Karnataka and others12, following the ratio decidendi in Amish Devgan (supra), this Court exercised power under Article 142 of the Constitution and consolidated six FIRs registered in the State to be tried together, as multiplicity of proceedings would not be in the larger public interest or in the interest of the State. Again, in Ravinder Singh Sidhu vs. State of Punjab and others13, this Court observed that it is now fairly well settled that multiplicity of proceedings would not be in the larger public interest and the correct course of action would be to merge the later FIRs with the earliest FIR with the State's consent. On the same lines, in Alok Kumar vs. State of Bihar and others14, this Court noted that 81 FIRs were registered and directed the first FIR to be treated as the main FIR and all other FIRs to be treated as statements under Section 161 CrPC. Earlier, in Satinder Singh Bhasin vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and another15, a 3-Judge Bench of this Court followed the principle enunciated in Amish Devgan (supra) and clubbed, with consent, the 118 FIRs relating to the Bike Bot scheme registered across the State of Uttar Pradesh and one FIR registered by the Economic Offences Wing, New Delhi, by exercising power under Article 142 of the Constitution. Before that, in Radhey Shyam vs. State of Haryana and others16, the very same 3-Judge Bench took note of multiple FIRs in connection with a network marketing scheme in as many 12 (2023) 14 SCC 801 13 2025 SCC OnLine SC 1164 14 2025 SCC OnLine SC 1728 15 (2023) 14 SCC 805 16 2022 SCC OnLine SC 1935 [2026] 1 S.C.R. 179 The State (NCT) of Delhi v. Khimji Bhai Jadeja as 12 States and directed the clubbing of all the FIRs, which could thereafter proceed to one trial as far as possible, duly noting that all the States concerned voiced no objection to such course of action. 17. However, in Amandeep Singh Saran vs. State of Delhi and others17, this Court refused to consolidate the FIRs registered against the petitioner therein in different States, not only under the provisions of the IPC but also invoking respective State enactments for which Special Courts were designated to try the offences thereunder, on the ground that clubbing of such FIRs would mean that the jurisdiction of such Special Courts would be taken away and a special jurisdiction would be conferred on that one Court where the FIRs were clubbed to try offences arising under different State enactments. 18. We must also refer to Narinderjit Singh Sahni and another vs. Union of India and others18, a decision that weighed heavily with the High Court in answering the reference. Therein, a 3-Judge Bench of this Court dealt with a case involving 250 FIRs registered throughout the country. The argument before this Court was that they constituted a single offence or, in the alternative, an offence which could only have been committed in the course of the same transaction. Dealing with this argument, the Bench observed that the fact situation did not permit any credence being given to the submission that the FIRs pertained to a single offence. It was held that each individual deposit agreement had to be treated as a separate and individual transaction brought about by the allurement of the financial companies, since the parties were different, the amount of deposit was different as also the period for which the deposit was made. The Bench, therefore, observed that all the characteristics of independent transactions were there and it did not see any compelling reason to hold otherwise. However, we may note, with all due respect, that there was no in-depth analysis of statutory provisions or case law in the context of commission of offences in the course of the same transaction, whereby persons accused of multiple offences committed in the course of that same transaction could be charged and tried together. In any event, the development of law on the point, referred to hereinabove, including later decisions of 3-Judge Benches, is indicative of the legal position 17 2023 SCC OnLine SC 1851 18 (2002) 2 SCC 210 180 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports prevailing as on date. The above referred judgments sum up the legal position adequately and we see no purpose in burdening this decision with more case law on the point. 19. We may note that Section 218(1) CrPC requires a distinct and separate charge for every distinct offence and each such separate charge should be tried separately. Sections 219 to 223 CrPC constitute exceptions to this general rule and stipulate the circumstances in which deviation therefrom can be made. Under Section 219 CrPC, three such offences committed during a year can be the subject matter of a single trial [now, five such offences, under Section 242 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 (BNSS)]. Under Sections 220(1) CrPC and 223(a) and (d) CrPC, consolidated charges can be framed against several accused persons in relation to several offences, if such offences are committed during the course of the same transaction. It would, therefore, turn upon the offences forming part of the 'same transaction'. 20. As already noted hereinabove, precedential law has laid down triple tests, though not to be applied cumulatively, to decide when separate actions can be treated as part of the 'same transaction' - 1) unity of purpose and design; 2) proximity of time and place; and 3) continuity of action. These tests may be applied to ascertain whether a series of acts form part of the same transaction or not. It is not necessary at the present stage to consider whether consolidation of charges under Section 220(1) CrPC should be resorted to, as that would depend upon the opinion of the Magistrate on the strength of the findings recorded during the investigation. If it is opined that all the incidents partake of the same transaction, there can be one trial under Section 220(1) CrPC and Section 223(a) and (d) CrPC. If, however, it is concluded that there are several transactions and distinct offences in relation to different victims, there have to be separate trials for each offence, subject to Section 219 CrPC/ Section 242 BNSS, which allows the Trial Court to try three/five offences of the same kind committed within a year. Once all the incidents are taken to be part of the same transaction and amalgamated into one FIR, the punishment would follow accordingly as per law. 21. We agree with the learned amicus that the reference by the learned Additional Sessions Judge was premature, as the stage had not arisen for her to have entertained any doubt so as to raise the questions of [2026] 1 S.C.R. 181 The State (NCT) of Delhi v. Khimji Bhai Jadeja law that she did for the decision of the High Court. The investigation was still ongoing and it could not have been ascertained at that stage as to whether the alleged offences formed part and parcel of the same transaction. Even otherwise, consolidation of FIRs is permissible in law but that would have also depended upon the conclusions to be arrived at after the investigation. However, as on date, as many as six supplementary chargesheets have been filed during the pendency of this case, in addition to the main chargesheet that was filed in the year 2014. We find that the end result of the investigation undertaken is that an offence under Section 120B IPC has been alleged, i.e., a criminal conspiracy. Therefore, as a conspiracy is alleged, leading to multiple acts of cheating against different individuals, the course adopted by the Delhi Police in registering one FIR and treating the complaints received from 1851 other complainants as statements under Section 161 CrPC, was the correct course of action to have been adopted at that stage. 22. The inference to be drawn from the chargesheets, as filed, is left to the Magistrate concerned to consider, so as to ascertain whether the various acts of cheating attributed to the accused persons constitute part of the 'same transaction', thereby bringing them within the ambit of Section 220(1) CrPC and Section 223 (a) & (d) CrPC. If the offences formed part of the same transaction, the Magistrate would be entitled to charge and try them together, as enabled by the aforestated provisions, as it would be in the larger public interest to do so. Further, in such an event, as pointed out in Amish Devgan (supra), the complainants, who would then be treated as witnesses in relation to the FIR which was first registered, would be entitled to file protest petitions in the event of a closure report being filed or if the Magistrate is inclined to discharge the accused, and the Magistrate concerned is bound to consider the same on merits. Coming to the aspect of sentencing, the provisions of Section 71 IPC along with Sections 31 and 325 CrPC would have to be adhered to, depending upon the established facts and findings in the case. 23. Viewed thus, we set aside the answers on questions (a) & (b) by the Division Bench of the High Court. The judgment dated 08.07.2019 passed by the High Court of Delhi in Criminal Reference No. 1 of 2014 is, accordingly, set aside to that extent. The appeal is allowed in the aforestated terms.\n\n182 [2026] 1 S.C.R.

Case Arising From CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Criminal Appeal No. 75 of 2026 From the Judgment and Order dated 28.06.2024 of the High Court of Karnataka at Bengaluru in CRLP No. 9119 of 2018 Appearances for Parties Advs. for the Appellant(s): Ashwin V. Kotemath, Harisha S.R. Judgment / Order of the Supreme Court Judgment Sanjay Kumar, J. 1. Leave granted. 2. Challenge in this appeal is to the order dated 28.06.2024 passed by a learned Judge of the Karnataka High Court in Criminal Petition No. 9119 of 2018. This petition was filed by S. Nagesh, the appellant before us, under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, seeking the quashing of the complaint in PCR No. 3144 of [2026] 1 S.C.R. 185 S. Nagesh v. Shobha S. Aradhya 2013, which was converted as CC No. 1439 of 2014 on the file of the learned I Additional I Civil Judge and Judicial Magistrate First Class at Mysore1. The learned Judge rejected the petition, holding that the delay of two days in the filing of the complaint was bonafide and cognizance had rightly been taken. 3. In her complaint in PCR No. 3144 of 2013, Shobha S. Aradhya, the respondent, averred as follows: The appellant had approached her husband and her, seeking financial assistance to purchase a house and to meet legal necessities. They lent him a sum of ₹5,40,000/- between the dates 27.01.2010 and 26.07.2010. He, thereafter, issued cheque dated 10.07.2013 drawn in her name for the said sum, assuring that it would be honoured upon presentation. However, the cheque was dishonoured on 17.07.2013 for insufficiency of funds. She got issued legal notice dated 13.08.2013 calling upon the appellant to pay the cheque amount within 15 days but the same was returned as 'unclaimed' on 22.08.2013. However, the copy of the notice sent through courier was not returned unserved and the same amounted to deemed service. However, no payment was made by the appellant. She, thereupon, filed the complaint praying that the Court take cognisance of the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 18812, and punish the appellant in accordance with law, apart from awarding her compensation. 4. The then learned Magistrate, after perusing the complaint and the documents, noted the presence of the complainant and took cognisance, vide order dated 09.10.2013. However, by order dated 23.05.2014, the successor learned Magistrate noted that, though there was a delay of two days in the filing of the complaint, his predecessor-in-office had already taken cognisance of the offence and granted liberty to the accused, viz., the appellant, to contest the delay at the time of the trial. The case was directed to be registered against the appellant for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the NI Act and summons were directed to be issued to him to appear on the next date of hearing. It was reiterated that liberty was granted to the appellant to contest the delay at the time of the trial. 1 For short, 'the learned Magistrate' 2 For short, 'the NI Act' 186 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports 5. Thereafter, by order dated 04.02.2016, the learned Magistrate noted that an application had been filed for condonation of the delay of two days in the presentation of the complaint and opined that the same required to be considered before the case went to trial on merits. Having considered the objections on the said application, the learned Magistrate passed order dated 30.10.2018 allowing it. Therein, it was noted that the complainant had stated in the condone delay application that she was suffering from viral fever and was, therefore, unable to present the complaint within time. The learned Magistrate also took note of the medical certificate produced by her, wherein it was stated that she was suffering from viral fever and was under treatment from 04.10.2013 to 07.10.2013. Opining that the delay of two days in the presentation of the complaint was purely bonafide, the learned Magistrate allowed the application; condoned the delay in the filing of the complaint; and directed issuance of a non-bailable warrant against the appellant. 6. Aggrieved by this turn of events, the appellant approached the High Court by way of Criminal Petition No. 9119 of 2018. This petition was filed on 06.12.2018. Therein, the appellant contended that there was a delay of sixteen days in the filing of the complaint and not just two days. He pointed out that the respondent had filed the complaint on 09.10.2013 and cognisance was taken by the learned Magistrate on the very same day. He contended that this procedure was totally opposed to the scheme of the NI Act. He further contended that the condonation of the delay of two days by the learned Magistrate, vide order dated 30.10.2018, was equally without jurisdiction and contrary to the statutory provisions. His specific argument was that the learned Magistrate did not have the jurisdiction to take cognisance before the delay was condoned and the steps taken to the contrary were in violation of the prescribed procedure. He also contested the matter on merits, denying his liability, and prayed for quashing of the complaint. 7. Perusal of the impugned order dated 28.06.2024 passed by the High Court reflects that the solitary issue focused upon by the appellant before the learned Judge was that the learned Magistrate could not have taken cognisance without first condoning the delay in the filing of the complaint. The learned Judge concurred with the view taken by the learned Magistrate that the delay in the filing of the complaint was actually two days and not more and [2026] 1 S.C.R. 187 S. Nagesh v. Shobha S. Aradhya that it was bonafide, justifying its condonation. Further, the learned Judge noted that the proviso to Section 142(1)(b) of the NI Act empowered the Court concerned to take cognisance of a complaint made even after the prescribed period of one month from the date on which the cause of action arose under clause (c) of the proviso to Section 138 of the NI Act, if the complainant satisfied the Court that he had sufficient cause for not making the complaint within that period. The learned Judge, therefore, observed that the legislature had conferred express power on the Court to take cognisance even in respect of a belated complaint, if sufficient cause for such belated presentation was established by the complainant. 8. Per the learned Judge, whether the Court condoned the delay after taking cognisance or whether it first condoned the delay and then took cognisance did not, in any way, vitiate the taking of cognisance as what was of consequence was whether the Court had condoned the delay in the presentation of the complaint. The learned Judge held that, if cognisance is taken without the delay in the presentation of the complaint being condoned, it would only be a curable irregularity. According to the learned Judge, it is only when the Court failed to condone the delay altogether, during the pendency of the proceedings, and went on to adjudicate the matter on merits that the proceedings would stand vitiated. 9. On facts, the learned Judge observed that the learned Magistrate had taken cognisance on 09.10.2013 without noticing that the complaint had been filed with delay, perhaps being misled by the erroneous averment in the complaint that it was filed within time. However, upon noticing the delay of two days in the presentation of the complaint, the learned Magistrate had observed that his predecessor-in-office had taken cognisance without noticing the delay and kept the said issue alive. The learned Judge held that, as the complaint was of the year 2013 and the matter had been pending for more than 11 years, there was no justification in considering the delay of two days in the filing of the complaint as of consequence. The learned Judge affirmed the condonation of that delay by the learned Magistrate and upheld the cognisance taken, though it was irregular, observing that the said irregularity stood cured on the delay being condoned. The appellant's petition was, accordingly, dismissed. 188 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports 10. The learned counsel for the appellant would argue that cognizance could not have been taken by the learned Magistrate of the belated complaint filed by the respondent without first considering and condoning the delay in the presentation of the complaint, provided sufficient cause was shown for such delay by her. He would contend that, in the light of the law laid down by a 3-Judge Bench of this Court in Dashrath Rupsingh Rathod vs. State of Maharashtra and another3, the learned Judge of the High Court was in error in rejecting the quash petition of the appellant. 11. Despite service of notice, the respondent did not choose to enter appearance before this Court till after the judgment in this case was reserved on 02.12.2025. However, a mention was made on 05.12.2025 by the learned counsel who was instructed to appear for the respondent. He was, accordingly, permitted to file his written submissions after entering appearance for the respondent. In his written submissions, the learned counsel admitted that the respondent's complaint was filed on 09.10.2013 and cognisance was taken on the very same day. Though the learned counsel stressed upon the order dated 23.05.2014 passed by the learned Magistrate remaining unchallenged, we may note that it was only on 30.10.2018 that the learned Magistrate condoned the delay of two days, thereby validating the cognisance taken by his predecessor-in-office even before an application for condonation of delay was filed. Therefore, the failure of the appellant to challenge the earlier orders is of no consequence. More so, as the learned Magistrate had, in fact, reserved the right of the appellant to raise the issue of delay during the trial but, having stated so, the learned Magistrate, thereafter, took upon himself the task of deciding the limitation issue and condoned the delay by the later order dated 30.10.2018. 12. At this stage, we may note that, in Dashrath Rupsingh Rathod (supra), it was held that cognisance under Section 142 of the NI Act of an offence under Section 138 thereof is forbidden except upon a complaint, in writing, made by the payee or holder of the cheque in due course within one month from the date the cause of action accrues to such payee or holder under clause (c) of the proviso to Section 138. It was observed that the proviso to Section 138 simply 3 (2014) 9 SCC 129 [2026] 1 S.C.R. 189 S. Nagesh v. Shobha S. Aradhya postpones institution of criminal proceedings and taking of cognisance by the Court till such time the cause of action in terms of clause (c) of the proviso accrues to the complainant. 13. We may note that the proviso to Section 142(1)(b) of the NI Act was inserted by Act 55 of 2002, with effect from 06.02.2003. Section 142(1)(b), to the extent relevant, reads as under: - 142. Cognizance of offences.-- (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) -- (a) ………; (b) such complaint is made within one month of the date on which the cause of action arises under clause (c) of the proviso to Section 138: Provided that the cognizance of a complaint may be taken by the Court after the prescribed period, if the complainant satisfies the Court that he had sufficient cause for not making a complaint within such period. 14. It is manifest from the clear and unambiguous language of the above proviso that the power conferred upon the Court to take cognisance of a belated complaint is subject to the complainant first satisfying the Court that he had sufficient cause for not making the complaint within time. The satisfaction in that regard, resulting in condonation of the delay, must therefore precede the act of taking cognizance. Ordinarily, a proceeding instituted with limitation-linked delay before a Court of law does not actually figure as a regular matter on its file until that delay is condoned. For example, Order XLI Rules 3A and 5(3) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, make this position amply clear in the context of belated presentation of civil appeals. Therefore, the approach of the High Court in treating this crucial aspect as a mere interchangeable exercise, i.e., either to first condone the delay or to first take cognisance, is not in keeping with the mandate of the aforestated proviso. We may note that the respondent was herself responsible for this imbroglio as she had made a categorical statement in her complaint that it was filed within time, when it was not. 15. On the above analysis, we have no hesitation in holding that the learned Magistrate erred in taking cognisance of the respondent's\n\n190 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports complaint under Section 138 of the NI Act, even before the delay of two days in its presentation was condoned. The order passed by the High Court refusing to quash the same is, thus, set aside. The appeal is accordingly allowed. In consequence, the complaint in PCR No. 3144 of 2013, which was converted as CC No. 1439 of 2014 on the file of the learned I Additional I Civil Judge and Judicial Magistrate First Class, Mysore, shall stand quashed.

[Para 9] Disciplinary enquiry vis-à-vis criminal prosecution - Presence of a witness - No consequence in not responding to a summons in departmental proceedings, unlike in criminal proceedings: Held: The exoneration was on the basis of two aspects, one, the Inspector of the ACB who carried out the trap having not been examined and the other, two independent witnesses accompanying the trap team having stated that they were standing outside the office room wherein the handing over of the bribe took place - The first ground of the Inspector not having been examined based on the preponderance of probabilities, is not imperative, especially when the two independent witnesses were examined - More so, insofar as the department not being at fault since three summons were taken out and a further request was made again for summoning the witness, which was declined by the Enquiry Officer - There would [2026] 1 S.C.R. 193 The Karnataka Lokayuktha Bagalkote District, Bagalkot v. Chandrashekar & Anr. be no consequence in not responding to a summons in departmental proceedings, while a like failure in criminal proceedings would be more drastic - The criminal court has ample powers to ensure the presence of a witness in a criminal proceeding, which the Enquiry Officer does not possess - The prosecuting agency and the one carrying on the departmental enquiry are two different entities - The trap was laid by the ACB, and the prosecution was conducted at the behest of the Lokayukta, and no laxity on the prosecuting agency can be presumed or anticipated of not bringing the Inspector to the box, before the criminal court - Moreover, the prosecution cannot be put an end on such anticipated laxity. [Para 21] Disciplinary enquiry - Enquiry officer vis-à-vis disciplinary authority: Held: Enquiry report in disciplinary proceedings is not conclusive of the guilt or otherwise of the delinquent employee, which finding is in the exclusive domain of the disciplinary authority - The enquiry officer is appointed only as a convenient measure to bring on record the allegations against the delinquent employee and the proof thereof and to ensure an opportunity to the delinquent employee to contest and defend the same by cross-examination of the witnesses proffered by the department and even production of further evidence, in defense - The enquiry officer merely records the evidence and the finding entered on the basis of the evidence led at the enquiry does not have any bearing on the final decision of the disciplinary authority - The disciplinary authority takes the ultimate call as to whether to concur with the findings of the enquiry authority or to differ therefrom - On a decision being taken to differ from the findings in the enquiry report as to the guilt of the delinquent employee, if it is in favour of the delinquent employee nothing more needs to be done since the enquiry stands closed exonerating the employee of the charges levelled - If the decision is to concur with the finding of guilt by the Enquiry Officer, then a show-cause is issued with the copy of the Enquiry Report - However, while differing from the finding of exoneration in the enquiry report, necessarily the disciplinary authority will not only have to issue a show-cause against the delinquent employee, with a copy of the Enquiry Report, but the show cause notice also has to specifically bring to attention of the delinquent, the aspects on which the disciplinary authority proposes to differ, based on the facts discovered in the enquiry so as to afford the delinquent employee an opportunity to proffer his defense to the same.

Case Arising From CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Criminal Appeal No. 77 of 2026 From the Judgment and Order dated 10.01.2025 of the High Court of Karnataka Circuit Bench at Dharwad in WP No. 104828 of 2024 [2026] 1 S.C.R. 195 The Karnataka Lokayuktha Bagalkote District, Bagalkot v.

Zeeshan Ali, Mehfuz Basar Mollah. Judgment / Order of the Supreme Court Judgment K. Vinod Chandran, J. Leave granted. 2. Despite this Court having consistently held that disciplinary proceedings and criminal prosecution, even on an identical allegation, are parallel proceedings, the relevance of the conclusion in one is often contended to be binding on the other. Trite is the principle that in a disciplinary proceeding, the proof is of preponderance of probabilities while in a criminal proceeding, it has the higher standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt. Often it is argued that the acquittal in the criminal proceedings should inure to the benefit of the accused/ delinquent employee in a disciplinary proceeding too. In the present case, we have a contrary contention of the disciplinary proceedings having exonerated the delinquent employee, who seeks absolution from the criminal prosecution. The contention is that when the allegations could not be proved in a disciplinary proceeding where the requirement is only of preponderance of probabilities, surely it cannot be proved beyond reasonable doubt. 3. The appellant is the Lokayukta of the State of Karnataka, an independent body tasked also to conduct enquiries on complaints of corruption and initiate and continue prosecution; such powers having been statutorily conferred under the Karnataka Lokayukta Act, 1984. On facts, suffice it to notice that the respondent, an Executive Engineer (Electrical) with the Works and Maintenance Division, HESCOM, Bagalkot regulated by the Karnataka Electricity Transmission Corporation Limited Regulations, was alleged to have demanded a bribe from an electrical contractor to clear five bills, at the rate of Rupees two thousand each. The contractor complained\n\n196 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports to the Anti-Corruption Bureau1 who prepared a trap, with identifiable, powdered notes kept in a packet entrusted with the complainant, to be handed over to the Executive Engineer. The trap was successful, and the notes were recovered from the pocket of the Executive Engineer whose hands turned pink on dipping in the prepared solution, which proved the taint of corruption. 4. Disciplinary proceedings were initiated and so was criminal prosecution launched, the former by the department itself and the latter by the Lokayukta who is the appellant herein. On the claim that the departmental proceedings ended in exoneration, the delinquent employee approached the High Court, for quashing the criminal proceedings. The High Court by the impugned judgment relied on Radheshyam Kejriwal v. State of W.B.2, a three-Judge Bench decision to hold that if there is an exoneration on merits where the allegation is found to be not sustainable at all and the person held innocent, then criminal proceedings on the same set of facts and circumstances cannot be allowed to continue especially based on the principle of higher standard of proof in criminal cases. The learned Single Judge also refused to follow a later judgment of this Court in State (NCT of Delhi) v. Ajay Kumar Tyagi3; finding the later judgment to be per incuriam, having been passed in ignorance of the earlier one. 5. There can be no doubt regarding the principle that if the later Bench holds contrary to the earlier Bench decision of coequal strength, on the same point, the contrary dictum expressed by the later Bench would be per incuriam as held by a Constitution Bench in National Insurance Company Limited v. Pranay Sethi4. But the question arising herein is as to whether there was a conflict with the earlier and later judgments. 6. In Radheshyam Kejriwal2, the raid on the premises of the appellant therein, by the Enforcement Directorate gave rise to proceedings under the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 19735. Initially, a 1 for short, the ACB 2 (2011) 3 SCC 581 3 (2012) 9 SCC 685 4 (2017) 16 SCC 680 5 for short, the FERA [2026] 1 S.C.R. 197 The Karnataka Lokayuktha Bagalkote District, Bagalkot v. Chandrashekar & Anr. show-cause notice was issued by the Director of the Enforcement Directorate proposing adjudication proceedings under Section 51 of the FERA, which, after explanation received was concluded with a decision taken by the Adjudicating Officer that the contravention of the provisions alleged cannot be sustained since the transaction itself is not proved. The said order became final for reason of the Enforcement Directorate having not challenged it. Later, on the same set of facts, as enabled under Section 56 of the FERA criminal proceedings were initiated, which even as per the enactment could be continued without any prejudice to any award of penalty by the Adjudicating Officer under Section 51 of the FERA. It is in this context that the three-Judge Bench, by a majority, held inter alia that though the adjudication and criminal proceedings are independent of each other, if in the former the offender is exonerated on merits then the criminal prosecution also comes to an inevitable end. It was also categorically found that if the exoneration in the adjudication proceeding is on a technical ground and not on merits, the prosecution could continue. 7. In Radheshyam Kejriwal2 the adjudication proceedings and the criminal proceedings were under the FERA, one for penalty; to recoup the economic loss caused by the transaction contravening the provisions of the statute and the other, prosecution; to provide penal consequences as a deterrent measure. The subject matter of the offence alleged in both proceedings was the contravention of the provisions of the statute through the transaction detected. When the adjudication proceedings found the transaction alleged to have not taken place, then it cuts at the root of the prosecution too. Other decisions under the FERA, where the two proceedings of adjudication and prosecution were found to be independent; the decision in one having no bearing on the other, were noticed. So were the decisions under the Income Tax Act, 19616 noticed, wherein, when the penalty imposed on a presumed violation of the provisions of the I.T. Act was set aside by the Tribunal; the last fact-finding authority under the scheme of the I.T. Act, for that reason alone the prosecution was found redundant and quashed. Radheshyam Kejriwal2 culled out the principles in the following manner: 6 For brevity 'the I.T. Act'\n\n198 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports 38. The ratio which can be culled out from these decisions can broadly be stated as follows: (i) Adjudication proceedings and criminal prosecution can be launched simultaneously; (ii) Decision in adjudication proceedings is not necessary before initiating criminal prosecution; (iii) Adjudication proceedings and criminal proceedings are independent in nature to each other; (iv) The finding against the person facing prosecution in the adjudication proceedings is not binding on the proceeding for criminal prosecution; (v) Adjudication proceedings by the Enforcement Directorate is not prosecution by a competent court of law to attract the provisions of Article 20(2) of the Constitution or Section 300 of the Code of Criminal Procedure; (vi) The finding in the adjudication proceedings in favour of the person facing trial for identical violation will depend upon the nature of finding. If the exoneration in adjudication proceedings is on technical ground and not on merit, prosecution may continue; and (vii) In case of exoneration, however, on merits where the allegation is found to be not sustainable at all and the person held innocent, criminal prosecution on the same set of facts and circumstances cannot be allowed to continue, the underlying principle being the higher standard of proof in criminal cases. 39. In our opinion, therefore, the yardstick would be to judge as to whether the allegation in the adjudication proceedings as well as the proceeding for prosecution is identical and the exoneration of the person concerned in the adjudication proceedings is on merits. In case it is found on merit that there is no contravention of the provisions of the Act in the adjudication proceedings, the trial of the person concerned shall be an abuse of the process of the court. [underlining by us for emphasis] [2026] 1 S.C.R. 199 The Karnataka Lokayuktha Bagalkote District, Bagalkot v. Chandrashekar & Anr. 8. In Radheshyam Kejriwal2 the very substratum of the allegation of violation of the provisions of FERA was found to be non-existent, an adjudication on merits that the transaction alleged had not occurred. In the instant case the Enquiry Report found that for reason of the Officer in charge of the trap having not been examined, the department was unable to establish the charge, not at all an exoneration on merits, but more a discharge for lack of diligence. The ratio decidendi of that case cannot be extended to every situation where a statute provides for a civil liability and a criminal liability, in which event Courts would be presuming what logically follows from the finding, without any application on the facts. 9. In a disciplinary enquiry the employer satisfies itself as to whether the misconduct alleged is proved and if proved, decides on the proportionate punishment that should be imposed; both of which are in the exclusive domain of the employer, to be determined on the standard of preponderance of probabilities. In a criminal prosecution launched what assumes significance is the criminality of the act complained of or detected which has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Both are independent of each other not only for reason of the nature of the proceedings and the standard of proof, but also for reason of the adjudication being carried on by two different entities, regulated by a different set of rules and more importantly decided on the basis of the evidence led in the independent proceedings. If evidence is not led properly in one case, it cannot govern the decision in the other case where evidence is led separately and independently. 10. No doubt, the principles in Radheshyam Kejriwal2 are applicable in a disciplinary inquiry, which was the specific question considered in Ajay Kumar Tyagi3; interestingly by the very same Hon'ble Judge who authored the majority judgment in Radheshyam Kejriwal2. True, the earlier decision was not noticed in the latter decision; according to us with just cause since there were distinctions on facts. 11. Ajay Kumar Tyagi3 was a case in which a successful trap was laid and there was exoneration in the enquiry conducted without a final order by the Disciplinary Authority. Therein the Disciplinary Authority had not passed an order, in deference to the pending criminal prosecution, which action of deferment was unsuccessfully challenged in a writ petition by the delinquent. Then a further writ petition was filed challenging the continuance of the criminal prosecution on the 200 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports ground of exoneration in the Enquiry Report, which stood allowed. The Disciplinary Authority then passed an order exonerating the delinquent, subject to a challenge to the quashing of the criminal proceedings. In the SLP filed against the order of quashing there was a reference to a larger Bench noting the divergence of opinion with regard to the quashing of a prosecution based on exoneration in a disciplinary proceeding. Even before answering the reference the larger Bench found the quashing to be wrong insofar as the Disciplinary Authority having power to differ from the findings in the report of enquiry and the High Court, in that case having upheld the action of the Disciplinary Authority, keeping in abeyance the final order. We pause here to notice that herein the Disciplinary Authority passed an order concurring with the findings in the Enquiry Report on 08.07.2024, produced as Annexure R-1, with a rider that the order is subject to the proceedings in the criminal case, the consequences of which would necessarily follow. 12. The reference too was answered in Ajay Kumar Tyagi3. A two-Judge Bench decision of this Court in P.S. Rajya v. State of Bihar7 was referred to wherein the criminal prosecution was quashed when the departmental proceedings concluded in exoneration. In P.S. Rajya7, the allegation was of possession of assets disproportionate to the source of income. The Central Vigilance Commission dealt with the charge and in its elaborate report concluded that the valuation report on which CBI placed reliance is of doubtful nature. The Court on facts found that the value given as a base for the chargesheet was not the value given in the reports subsequently given by the valuers. The decision in P.S. Rajya7 relying on State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal8; the water shed decision in invocation of the inherent powers under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 for quashing criminal prosecution, held that the prosecution in that case should be quashed for more than one reason as laid down in Bhajan Lal8. Ajay Kumar Tyagi3 categorically held that the quashing of criminal proceedings in P.S. Rajya7 was not merely on account of the exoneration in the disciplinary proceedings. Referring to a number of decisions, it was held so in paragraphs 24 & 25 which are extracted hereunder: 7 (1996) 9 SCC 1 8 (1992) Supp. 1 SCC 335 [2026] 1 S.C.R. 201 The Karnataka Lokayuktha Bagalkote District, Bagalkot v. Chandrashekar & Anr. \"24. Therefore, in our opinion, the High Court quashed the prosecution on total misreading of the judgment in P.S. Rajya case (1996) 9 SCC 1. In fact, there are precedents, to which we have referred to above, that speak eloquently a contrary view i.e. exoneration in departmental proceeding ipso facto would not lead to exoneration or acquittal in a criminal case. On principle also, this view commends us. It is well settled that the standard of proof in a department proceeding is lower than that of criminal prosecution. It is equally well settled that the departmental proceeding or for that matter criminal cases have to be decided only on the basis of evidence adduced therein. Truthfulness of the evidence in the criminal case can be judged only after the evidence is adduced therein and the criminal case cannot be rejected on the basis of the evidence in the departmental proceeding or the report of the inquiry officer based on those evidence. 25. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the exoneration in the departmental proceeding ipso facto would not result in the quashing of the criminal prosecution. We hasten to add, however, that if the prosecution against an accused is solely based on a finding in a proceeding and that finding is set aside by the superior authority in the hierarchy, the very foundation goes and the prosecution may be quashed. But that principle will not apply in the case of the departmental proceeding as the criminal trial and the departmental proceeding are held by two different entities. Further, they are not in the same hierarchy.\" 13. We are of the opinion that in the present case the distinction as brought out in Ajay Kumar Tyagi3 squarely applies and the ratio decidendi therein is not regulated by the ratio of the earlier judgment in Radheshyam Kejriwal2. In Radheshyam Kejriwal2, the adjudication proceedings and the prosecution were both by the very same entity, the Enforcement Directorate under the FERA. In Ajay Kumar Tyagi3, the allegation was of a demand and acceptance of bribe in which a trap was laid, and the prosecution was commenced and continued by the ACB while the departmental proceedings were by the Delhi Jal Board under which the delinquent employee worked. Identical is the fact in this case where the ACB laid the trap, commenced and 202 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports continued the criminal proceedings, at the behest of the appellant, while the department carried on with the enquiry. The findings in the enquiry report also do not persuade us to quash the criminal proceedings as we would presently notice. 14. At the outset, we cannot but reiterate that the enquiry report in disciplinary proceedings is not conclusive of the guilt or otherwise of the delinquent employee, which finding is in the exclusive domain of the disciplinary authority. The enquiry officer is appointed only as a convenient measure to bring on record the allegations against the delinquent employee and the proof thereof and to ensure an opportunity to the delinquent employee to contest and defend the same by cross-examination of the witnesses proffered by the department and even production of further evidence, in defense. The enquiry officer, strictly speaking, merely records the evidence and the finding entered on the basis of the evidence led at the enquiry does not have any bearing on the final decision of the disciplinary authority. The disciplinary authority takes the ultimate call as to whether to concur with the findings of the enquiry authority or to differ therefrom. On a decision being taken to differ from the findings in the enquiry report as to the guilt of the delinquent employee, if it is in favour of the delinquent employee nothing more needs to be done since the enquiry stands closed exonerating the employee of the charges levelled. If the decision is to concur with the finding of guilt by the Enquiry Officer, then a show-cause is issued with the copy of the Enquiry Report. However, while differing from the finding of exoneration in the enquiry report, necessarily the disciplinary authority will not only have to issue a show-cause against the delinquent employee, with a copy of the Enquiry Report, but the show-cause notice also has to specifically bring to attention of the delinquent, the aspects on which the disciplinary authority proposes to differ, based on the facts discovered in the enquiry so as to afford the delinquent employee an opportunity to proffer his defense to the same. 15. Having thus stated the law regulating the final decision in a departmental enquiry, we cannot but notice that in the present case, there is a final order produced as passed by the Disciplinary Authority. The learned Counsel for the respondent vehemently argued that a retired District Judge was the Enquiry Officer, which according to us gives the enquiry no higher sanctity than that would be conferred on any enquiry report in any disciplinary proceeding carried out by [2026] 1 S.C.R. 203 The Karnataka Lokayuktha Bagalkote District, Bagalkot v. Chandrashekar & Anr. a person not trained in law. The Enquiry Officer often is appointed as an independent person who would have no connection with the management to ensure against any allegation of bias. A retired judicial officer being appointed as an enquiry officer does not confer the enquiry report any higher value or greater sanctity than that is normally available to such reports. We cannot but observe that in this case the Enquiry Officer fell into an error by requiring proof at a higher level than that necessary under preponderance of probabilities and so did the Disciplinary Authority, in concurring with the same. 16. We also notice the specific findings in the enquiry report. The exoneration was on the basis of two aspects, one, the Inspector of the ACB who carried out the trap having not been examined and the other, two independent witnesses accompanying the trap team having stated that they were standing outside the office room wherein the handing over of the bribe took place. The first ground of the Inspector not having been examined, according to us, based on the preponderance of probabilities, is not imperative, especially when the two independent witnesses were examined. More so, insofar as the department not being at fault since three summons were taken out and a further request was made again for summoning the witness, which was declined by the Enquiry Officer. We cannot but notice that there would be no consequence in not responding to a summons in departmental proceedings, while a like failure in criminal proceedings would be more drastic. The criminal court has ample powers to ensure the presence of a witness in a criminal proceeding, which the Enquiry Officer does not possess. In this context, the fact that the prosecuting agency and the one carrying on the departmental enquiry being two entities assumes significance. Further, here the trap was laid by the ACB, and the prosecution was conducted at the behest of the Lokayukta, and we cannot presume or anticipate any laxity on the prosecuting agency of not bringing the Inspector to the box, before the criminal court. More pertinently we cannot, on such anticipated laxity put an end to the prosecution. 17. We looked at the evidence laid at the enquiry, not to regulate the order in the departmental proceedings which is not challenged before us, but to satisfy ourselves and to understand whether there is total exoneration on merits, which we find to be absent. In the present case, the witnesses proffered by the department where, (i) the complainant; the contractor who complained of the demand of 204 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports bribe and (ii) two independent witnesses, government officers in two different departments who accompanied the trap team. PW-1, the complainant categorically stated that a bribe was demanded from him of Rupees ten thousand to clear five bills at the rate of Rupees two thousand each. He complained to the ACB whose Inspector marked the notes, powdered them and put them in a packet, after noting down the numbers to later identify them. The trap team along with the complainant and two witnesses went to the office of the delinquent employee. The complainant went inside the office room wherein he handed over the packet containing the money to the delinquent employee, who counted and put it in his pant's pocket, clearly spoken of by the complainant at the enquiry. The complainant gave the signal as agreed upon, a missed call on the mobile, when the trap team went in, checked the pockets of the delinquent employee, recovered the packet with the money and when the hands of the delinquent employee were dipped in the solution earlier prepared, the colour changed bringing forth the taint. 18. PW-2 and PW-3 were the independent witnesses who were standing outside the office room when the complainant went in. They deposed that on the signal being given, the officers went inside the room and the witnesses followed. They witnessed the money being taken out from the pocket of the delinquent and the delinquent's hands being dipped in a solution which displayed the tainted colour. Even without the examination of the Inspector who laid the trap we are of the opinion that there was sufficient proof on the standard of preponderance of probabilities to find the delinquent guilty of the charge of demand and acceptance of bribe. The complainant and the independent witnesses have spoken about the incident of the successful trap laid. 19. On the principles of law as stated hereinabove and also on the peculiar facts coming out from the above case, we are not convinced that this is a fit case where the criminal proceedings can be quashed on the exoneration of the delinquent employee in a departmental enquiry. We find the decision in Ajay Kumar Tyagi3 to be squarely applicable. The appeal stands allowed permitting the continuation of criminal proceedings. We make it clear that since the disciplinary authority has accepted the enquiry report, there cannot be reopening of the same based on the findings hereinabove; but a conviction in the criminal case would bring in consequences as mandated by\n\n[2026] 1 S.C.R. 205 The Karnataka Lokayuktha Bagalkote District, Bagalkot v. Chandrashekar & Anr. rules regulating the service, specifically reserved in the order of the disciplinary authority, Annexure R-1. 20. The Appeal stands allowed. 21. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of. Result of the case: Appeal allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Divya Pandey", "2026_1_1_23_EN_2026": "[2026] 1 S.C.R. 1 : 2026 INSC 5 Motilal Oswal Financial Services Limited v.

Shah, Ms. Sanjana Saddy. Advs. for the Respondent(s): Rishabh Shah, Dhaval Mehrotra, Ms. Shivani Bansal, Ms. Aditi Desai, For M/s. ADS Legal. Judgment / Order of the Supreme Court Judgment K.V. Viswanathan, J. 1. Leave granted. 2. The present appeal calls in question the correctness of the order dated 02.05.2024 passed by the Single Judge of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay in Commercial Arbitration Application No.9 of 2024. By the said order, the learned Single Judge allowed the Section 11 Application filed by the respondent under the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 (for short \"the A&C Act\") and appointed an arbitrator to adjudicate the dispute between the parties. The only objection taken by the appellant herein was that the dispute is non-arbitrable in view of Section 41 of the Presidency Small Cause Courts Act, 1882 (for short \"the 1882 Act\"). The learned Single Judge made a short shrift of the said objection by holding that the place where the property in question, which was the subject matter of the dispute, was situated, i.e. Malad, was outside the jurisdiction of the Small Causes Court. This finding has now turned out to be [2026] 1 S.C.R. 5 Motilal Oswal Financial Services Limited v. Santosh Cordeiro and Another a damp squib, since parties before us are ad idem that Malad area is covered under the jurisdiction of the Small Causes Court. We could have rest content by remanding the matter to the High Court for fresh consideration. However, that will only prolong the dispute and, hence, we have decided to answer the issues arising in the case ourselves. BRIEF FACTS OF THE CASE: - 3. With regard to the premises situated at Unit No.718, admeasuring 2925 sq. ft., 7th Floor, Palm Spring Centre, Link Road, Malad (West), Mumbai, the appellant entered into a Leave and License Agreement on 06.10.2017 with the respondent. The period of the Leave and License was 60 months from 01.10.2017 to 30.10.2022. Though the appellant terminated the said agreement on 31.12.2019, after exchange of correspondence between the parties, the said termination was reversed and an Addendum dated 13.03.2020 was entered into extending the Leave and License period from 60 months to 96 months with a lock-in period of 72 months. 4. According to the appellant, due to COVID-19 pandemic, they were unable to continue the arrangement and citing the force majeure clause in the agreement, they handed over the keys and vacant peaceful possession of the premises to the respondent on 09.09.2020. According to the appellant, they intimated the respondents about the same on 10.10.2020 by writing an email. The appellant also sought refund of the security deposit. 5. On 28.06.2023, the respondent No.1 called upon the appellant to pay a sum of Rs.94,40,152/- along with interest @ 24% towards the alleged arrears of license fees for the balance lock-in period i.e. from 01.09.2020 to 14.06.2023. The appellants wrote back on 17.07.2023 denying any liability and seeking refund of security deposit of Rs. 10 lakhs. 6. The appellant on 17.07.2023 received a notice dated 15.07.2023 issued by the respondent under Section 21 of the A&C Act invoking Clause 33 of the arbitration agreement of the Leave and License Agreement dated 06.10.2017 and Addendum dated 13.03.2020. Clause 33 of the Leave and License Agreement dated 06.10.2017 reads as under: - 6 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports \"In the event of the any dispute or difference arising between the Licensors and the Licensee hereto concerning or relating to the interpretation of these presents or the interpretation or effect of any provisions thereof or relating to the liability or obligation on the part of any of the parties hereto, the same shall be referred to arbitration and Sole Arbitrator shall be appointed by the mutual consent of the Parties. The award passed by the sole arbitrator shall be binding on both the parties. The arbitration shall be in Mumbai and in accordance with and subject to the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 or any statutory modification or re-enhancements thereof for the time being in force.\" This was followed by an application under Section 11 of the A&C Act filed on 13.08.2023 by the respondent seeking appointment of a sole arbitrator in accordance with clause 33 set out above. 7. On 01.11.2023, the appellant filed its reply objecting to the appointment of the arbitrator and specifically relied on Section 41 of the 1882 Act and contended that only the Small Causes Court would have exclusive jurisdiction to entertain and try any suit or proceeding arising from the relationship between a licensor and licensee and that since the said statute is a special remedy, the dispute is not arbitrable. The High Court, by its order dated 02.05.2024, allowed the application and appointed the arbitrator. 8. Section 41 of the 1882 Act reads as under:- \"41. Suits or Proceedings between licensors and licensees or landlords and tenants for recovery of possession of immovable property and license fees or rent, except to those to which other Acts apply to lie in Small Cause Court.- (1) Notwithstanding anything contained elsewhere in this Act but subject to the provisions of sub-section (2), the Court of Small Cause shall have jurisdiction to entertain and try all suits and proceedings between a licensor and licensee, or a landlord and tenant, relating to the recovery of possession of any immovable property situated in Greater Bombay, or relating to the recovery of the licence fee or charges or rent therefor, irrespective of the value of the subject-matter of such suits or proceedings.\n\n[2026] 1 S.C.R. 7 Motilal Oswal Financial Services Limited v. Santosh Cordeiro and Another (2) Nothing contained in sub-section (1) shall apply to suits or proceedings for the recovery of possession of any immovable property, or of licence fee for charges of rent thereof, to which the provisions of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, 1947, the Bombay Government Premises (Eviction) Act, 1955, the Bombay Municipal Corporation Act, the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Act, 1976 or any other law for the time being in force, apply.\" 9. Proceedings before the arbitrator were carried on. On 03.06.2024, the appellant raised the ground of non-arbitrability under Section 41 of the 1882 Act and filed a Section 16 application under the A&C Act before the arbitrator. On 11.10.2024, the arbitrator dismissed the Section 16 application by holding that the amount sought to be recovered partakes the character of a 'debt' and is not a claim for license fee for use and occupation. On 28.01.2025, the Special Leave Petition was filed before this Court and this Court, on 21.02.2025, stayed the impugned order. That is how the matter presents itself before us. 10. We have heard Mr. Chirag M. Shah, learned advocate, for the appellant and Mr. Rishabh Shah, learned advocate for the respondents. We have perused the records as well as written submissions filed by the respective parties. CONTENTIONS OF THE APPELLANT: - 11. The learned counsel for the appellant contends that in the Section 11 application filed by the respondents, a clear case for recovery of license fee was sought, and expressly it was stated that the amount claimed did not partake the character of damages; that the reliance on the judgment of the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court in Globsport India Pvt. Ltd. vs. Mayfair Housing Pvt. Ltd1 was untenable in view of the Full Bench judgment of the Bombay High Court in Central Warehousing Corporation, Mumbai v. Fortpoint Automotive Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai2; that Central Warehousing (supra) clearly holds that exclusive jurisdiction is conferred on the Court 1 (2015) OnLine Bom 4176 2 2009 SCC OnLine Bom 2023 8 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports of Small Causes to entertain and decide all suits and proceedings between a licensor and licensee or a landlord and tenant relating to recovery of possession or recovery of license fee/rent in respect of premises situated in Greater Bombay; that this Court in Natraj Studios Private Limited. v. Navrang Studios and Another3, while interpreting a pari materia provision held that the parties could not contract out of a special legislation that conferred exclusive jurisdiction over landlord-tenant disputes to the Small Causes Court; that as long as the suit was between a licensor and licensee or a landlord and tenant, concerning immovable property, relating to recovery of possession or recovery of license fee, charges or rent, it will lie only before the Small Causes Court and the jurisdiction of all other courts is ousted; that the 1882 Act is a special legislation with a special purpose and grants exclusive jurisdiction on special courts which have been set up under such legislation and that in Booz Allen and Hamilton Inc vs. SBI Home Finance Limited And Others4, this Court held that tenancy/licensor/licensee disputes governed by special statutes are not arbitrable. CONTENTIONS OF THE RESPONDENT: - 12. The learned counsel for the respondent submitted the only exclusion in Clause 355 of the agreement was that the arbitrator was not to have power to interfere or arbitrate on issue of vacating the premises on expiry of license period and there was no bar to arbitrate on the obligation on the parties to pay the license fee/rent/use and occupation charges; that the dispute was only for payment of compensation for the \"balance lock-in period\"; that the claim of the respondents is neither for recovery of possession nor license fee; that the respondents' case is supported by the judgment in Globsport (supra); that the judgment in Vidya Drolia And Others vs. Durga Trading Corporation6, (hereinafter called Vidya Drolia - II), makes it clear that mere conferral of jurisdiction on a specific court or creation of a public fora would not be decisive to answer the issue of arbitrability 3 (1981) 1 SCC 523 4 (2011) 5 SCC 532 5 The reference to arbitration will in no way affect the obligation of the Licensee to vacate the licensed premises on the expiry or earlier determination of the License period and the arbitrators shall have no power to interfere with or arbitrate on issue of vacating the licensed premises on expiry of the licensed period. 6 (2021) 2 SCC 1\n\n[2026] 1 S.C.R. 9 Motilal Oswal Financial Services Limited v. Santosh Cordeiro and Another or otherwise of a dispute; and that no statutory protection under the Maharashtra Rent Control Act was denied to the appellant. QUESTION FOR CONSIDERATION: - 13. In the above background, the question for consideration is whether the High Court has rightly allowed the application filed by the respondent under Section 11 of the A&C Act? ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION: - 14. There is no dispute that the Leave and License agreement of 06.10.2017, in Clause 33, contained an Arbitration clause. In a proceeding under Section 11 of the A&C Act, the Court is to confine the examination to the existence of an Arbitration Agreement. Section 11 (6-A) which was brought into force with effect from 23.10.2015, though omitted by Act 33 of 2019, the omission has not yet been notified. 15. Section 11(6A) of the A&C Act is reproduced hereunder:- \"11. Appointment of arbitrators.--(1) xxx xxx . (2) xxx xxx (3) xxx xxx (4) xxx xxx (5) xxx xxx (6) xxx xxx (6A) The Supreme Court or, as the case may be, the High Court, while considering any application under sub- section (4) or sub-section (5) or sub-section (6), shall, notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of any Court, confine to the examination of the existence of an arbitration agreement.\" 16. A Seven Judge Bench of this Court in In re Interplay Between Arbitration Agreements under Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 & Stamp Act, 18997, (hereinafter called as 'In re-Interplay') 7 (2024) 6 SCC 1 10 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports while dealing with the aspect of how Vidya Drolia (Supra) proceeded on the assumption that Section 11(6-A) has been omitted, clarified the position thus:- \"62. A plain reading of Section 11(6-A) makes it evident that it is referring to an arbitration agreement. Section 11(6-A) provides that courts must confine themselves to an examination of the existence of the arbitration agreement. The word \"confine\" indicates the intention of the legislature to limit the jurisdiction of the Courts at the stage of the appointment of an arbitrator. 63. In Vidya Drolia [Vidya Drolia v. Durga Trading Corpn., (2021) 2 SCC 1], this Court held : (SCC p. 49, para 21) \"21. The term \"agreement\" is not defined in the Arbitration Act, albeit it is defined in Section 10 of the Contract Act, 1872 (for short \"the Contract Act\"), … as contracts made by free consent of parties competent to contract, for a lawful consideration and with a lawful object, and are not thereby expressly declared to be void. Section 10 of the Contract Act also stipulates that aforesaid requirements shall not affect any law in force in India (and not expressly repealed) by which a contract is required to be made in writing, in presence of witnesses or any law relating to registration of documents. Thus, an arbitration agreement should satisfy the mandate of Section 10 of the Contract Act, in addition to satisfying other requirements stipulated in Section 7 of the Arbitration Act.\" 64. The above observations are correct insofar as the arbitration agreement must satisfy the requirements of the Contract Act. However, the authority empowered to adjudicate whether the requirements of the Contract Act are satisfied is the Arbitral Tribunal, under Section 16 of the Arbitration Act. This is addressed in greater detail in the following segments. 163. We are of the opinion that the above premise of the Court in Vidya Drolia [Vidya Drolia v. Durga Trading Corpn., [(2021) 2 SCC 1] is erroneous because the omission of Section 11(6-A) has not been notified and, therefore, the\n\n[2026] 1 S.C.R. 11 Motilal Oswal Financial Services Limited v. Santosh Cordeiro and Another said provision continues to remain in full force. Since Section 11(6-A) continues to remain in force, pending the notification of the Central Government, it is incumbent upon this Court to give true effect to the legislative intent. 164. The 2015 Amendment Act has laid down different parameters for judicial review under Section 8 and Section 11. Where Section 8 requires the Referral Court to look into the prima facie existence of a valid arbitration agreement, Section 11 confines the Court's jurisdiction to the examination of the existence of an arbitration agreement. Although the object and purpose behind both Sections 8 and 11 is to compel parties to abide by their contractual understanding, the scope of power of the Referral Courts under the said provisions is intended to be different. The same is also evident from the fact that Section 37 of the Arbitration Act allows an appeal from the order of an Arbitral Tribunal refusing to refer the parties to arbitration under Section 8, but not from Section 11. Thus, the 2015 Amendment Act has legislatively overruled the dictum of Patel Engg. [SBP & Co. v. Patel Engg. Ltd., (2005) 8 SCC 618] where it was held that Section 8 and Section 11 are complementary in nature. Accordingly, the two provisions cannot be read as laying down a similar standard. 165. The legislature confined the scope of reference under Section 11(6-A) to the examination of the existence of an arbitration agreement. The use of the term \"examination\" in itself connotes that the scope of the power is limited to a prima facie determination. Since the Arbitration Act is a self-contained code, the requirement of \"existence\" of an arbitration agreement draws effect from Section 7 of the Arbitration Act. In Duro Felguera [Duro Felguera, S.A. v. Gangavaram Port Ltd., (2017) 9 SCC 729, this Court held that the Referral Courts only need to consider one aspect to determine the existence of an arbitration agreement -- whether the underlying contract contains an arbitration agreement which provides for arbitration pertaining to 12 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports the disputes which have arisen between the parties to the agreement. Therefore, the scope of examination under Section 11(6-A) should be confined to the existence of an arbitration agreement on the basis of Section 7. Similarly, the validity of an arbitration agreement, in view of Section 7, should be restricted to the requirement of formal validity such as the requirement that the agreement be in writing. This interpretation also gives true effect to the doctrine of competence-competence by leaving the issue of substantive existence and validity of an arbitration agreement to be decided by Arbitral Tribunal under Section 16. We accordingly clarify the position of law laid down in Vidya Drolia [Vidya Drolia v. Durga Trading Corpn., (2021) 2 SCC 1 in the context of Section 8 and Section 11 of the Arbitration Act. 166. The burden of proving the existence of arbitration agreement generally lies on the party seeking to rely on such agreement. In jurisdictions such as India, which accept the doctrine of competence-competence, only prima facie proof of the existence of an arbitration agreement must be adduced before the Referral Court. The Referral Court is not the appropriate forum to conduct a mini-trial by allowing the parties to adduce the evidence in regard to the existence or validity of an arbitration agreement. The determination of the existence and validity of an arbitration agreement on the basis of evidence ought to be left to the Arbitral Tribunal. This position of law can also be gauged from the plain language of the statute. 167. Section 11(6-A) uses the expression \"examination of the existence of an arbitration agreement\". The purport of using the word \"examination\" connotes that the legislature intends that the Referral Court has to inspect or scrutinise the dealings between the parties for the existence of an arbitration agreement. Moreover, the expression \"examination\" does not connote or imply a laborious or contested inquiry. [ P. Ramanatha Aiyar, The Law Lexicon (2nd Edn., 1997) 666.] On the other hand, Section 16 provides that the\n\n[2026] 1 S.C.R. 13 Motilal Oswal Financial Services Limited v. Santosh Cordeiro and Another Arbitral Tribunal can \"rule\" on its jurisdiction, including the existence and validity of an arbitration agreement. A \"ruling\" connotes adjudication of disputes after admitting evidence from the parties. Therefore, it is evident that the Referral Court is only required to examine the existence of arbitration agreements, whereas the Arbitral Tribunal ought to rule on its jurisdiction, including the issues pertaining to the existence and validity of an arbitration agreement. A similar view was adopted by this Court in Shin-Etsu Chemical Co. Ltd. v. Aksh Optifibre Ltd., (2005) 7 SCC 234]. 169. When the Referral Court renders a prima facie opinion, neither the Arbitral Tribunal, nor the Court enforcing the arbitral award will be bound by such a prima facie view. If a prima facie view as to the existence of an arbitration agreement is taken by the Referral Court, it still allows the Arbitral Tribunal to examine the issue in depth. Such a legal approach will help the Referral Court in weeding out prima facie non-existent arbitration agreements. It will also protect the jurisdictional competence of the Arbitral Tribunals to decide on issues pertaining to the existence and validity of an arbitration agreement.\" [Emphasis supplied] 17. Hence, it is very clear that our jurisdiction is only to inspect or scrutinize the dealings between the parties for determination about the existence of an Arbitration Agreement. We are not to launch a laborious or a contested inquiry. 18. Our task would have been much simpler but for the reliance placed by the learned counsel for the appellant on the Full Bench judgment of the Bombay High Court in Central Warehousing (supra). Central Warehousing (supra) examined the question whether in view of Section 58 of the A&C Act, if in any agreement between licensor 8 Extent of judicial intervention.- Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, in matters governed by this Part, no judicial authority shall intervene except where so provided in this Part. 14 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports and licensee an arbitration clause exists, the jurisdiction of the Small Causes Court under the Presidency Small Causes Court Act, 1882, would be ousted. 19. While answering the said question, the Full Bench traced the legislative history of Section 41(2) of the Act of 1882. It found that the object of introducing Section 41 in the amended form, was to avoid multiplicity of proceedings in different Courts and consequent waste of public time and money and to avoid unnecessary delay and hardship to the suitors. The Full Bench found that the objective was to have uniformity of the procedure so that all suits and proceedings between a landlord and tenant or a licensor and licensee for recovery of possession of premises or for recovery of rent or license fee, irrespective of the value of the subject matter, should go to and be disposed of by Small Causes Court. The Full Bench found that the provision vested exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Small Causes to entertain such suits. Ultimately, for the purpose of our case we only need to deal with the operative portion set out in Para 40 of the said judgment which reads as under: - \"40. In summation, we would hold that section 41(1) of the Act of 1882 is a special law which in turn has constituted special Courts for adjudication of disputes specified therein between the licensor and licensee or a landlord and tenant. The effect of section 41(2) of the Act of 1882 is only the suits or proceedings for recovery of possession of immovable property or of licence fee thereof, to which, the provisions of specified Acts or any other law for the time being in force apply, have been excepted from the application of non-obstante clause contained in section 41(1) of the Act. The expression \"or any other law for the time being in force\" appearing in section 41(2) will have to be construed to mean that such law should provide for resolution of disputes between licensor and licensee or a landlord and tenant in relation to immovable property or licence fee thereof, to which immovable property, the provisions of that Act are applicable. The Act of 1996 is not covered within the ambit of section 41(2) in particular the expression \"or any other law for the time being in force\" contained therein. The question whether the exclusive jurisdiction of the Small Causes Court vested in terms of\n\n[2026] 1 S.C.R. 15 Motilal Oswal Financial Services Limited v. Santosh Cordeiro and Another section 41 of the Act of 1882 is ousted, if an agreement between the licensor and licensee contains a clause for arbitration, the same will have to be answered in the negative. For, section 5 of the Act of 1996 in that sense is not an absolute non-obstante clause. Section 5 of the Act of 1996 cannot affect the laws for the time being in force by virtue of which certain disputes may not be submitted to arbitration, as stipulated in section 2(3) of the Act of 1996. We hold that section 41 of the Act of 1882 falls within the ambit of section 2(3) of the Act of 1996. As a result of which, even if the Licence Agreement contains Arbitration Agreement, the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of Small Causes under section 41 of the Act of 1882 is not affected in any manner. Whereas, Arbitration Agreement in such cases would be invalid and inoperative on the principle that it would be against public policy to allow the parties to contract out of the exclusive jurisdiction of the Small Causes Courts by virtue of section 41 of the Act of 1882.\" [Emphasis supplied] 20. The appellant relies on the above paragraph which holds that the Arbitration Agreement in the situation referred to in the paragraph would be invalid and inoperative on the principle that it would be against public policy to allow the parties to contract out of the exclusive jurisdiction of Small Causes Court by virtue of Section 41 of the Act of 1882. 21. The learned counsel for the appellant submits that in view of this holding, even while examining within the contours of Section 11(6-A) this Court will be obliged to conclude that no arbitration agreement existed. We are not able to countenance the submission of the learned counsel for the appellant for the following reasons: - I. (a). Firstly, Central Warehousing (supra) has to be understood in the context in which it came to be decided. The said context does not obtain here. In Central Warehousing (supra), the petitioner therein, issued termination notices terminating the storage warehouse facilities of the respondent therein - FAP Limited. In response thereto, the respondent therein FAP Limited invoked the arbitration clause. Respondent-FAP Limited 16 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports thereafter, filed a suit under Section 41 of the Act of 1882 for a declaration that the agreement providing storage facility was subsisting and obtained interim orders restraining the petitioner therein from giving effect to the termination notices. The petitioner therein - Central Warehousing raised an objection based on the provisions of Section 8 of the A&C Act. The preliminary objection was overruled. Aggrieved, Central Warehousing approached the High Court under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. What is significant to notice is that the respondent therein FAP Limited was in possession of the premises. (b). In the present case, it is undisputed by both parties that possession had been handed over by the appellant to the respondents in September 2020. The dispute between the parties is with regard to a monetary claim with the appellant asserting that the security deposit should be repaid by the respondents and the respondents claiming sums of money towards alleged arrears of amounts payable for the balance lock-in period. This aspect is set out only for explaining the context of the present case and contrasting with the context in Central Warehousing (supra). II. (a). Secondly, pursuant to a reference made to a three- Judge Bench in Vidya Drolia and Others v. Durga Trading Corporation9., (hereinafter called Vidya Drolia-I), this Court pronounced the judgment in Vidya Drolia-II (supra). Though the judgment in re - Interplay (supra) corrected Vidya Drolia-II on the aspect of the continuance of Section 11(6-A) in the statute and the interpretation of the said sub-section, the other aspects in Vidya Drolia-II have not been diluted in re - Interplay (supra). (b). Vidya Drolia-II was actually occasioned due to another judgment of this Court in Himangni Enterprises v. Kamaljeet Singh Ahluwalia10, which had treated cases of ejectment under the Transfer of Property Act similar to cases of eviction under the Rent Control Act of the State. The Bench in Vidya Drolia-I doubted the said judgment and in a detailed referral order distinguished the applicability of the prior judgments of 9 (2019) 20 SCC 406 10 (2017) 10 SCC 706\n\n[2026] 1 S.C.R. 17 Motilal Oswal Financial Services Limited v. Santosh Cordeiro and Another this Court in Natraj Studios (supra) and Booz Allen (supra) to ejectment suits under the Transfer of Property Act. (c). While dealing with the aspect of implied bars on arbitrability, Vidya Drolia-II made the following pertinent observations: - \"53.Dhulabhai case [Dhulabhai v. State of M.P., (1968) 3 SCR 662 : AIR 1969 SC 78] is not directly applicable as it relates to exclusion of jurisdiction of civil courts, albeit we respectfully agree with the order of reference [Vidya Drolia v. Durga Trading Corpn., (2019) 20 SCC 406] that Condition 2 is apposite while examining the question of non-arbitrability. Implied legislative intention to exclude arbitration can be seen if it appears that the statute creates a special right or a liability and provides for determination of the right and liability to be dealt with by the specified courts or the tribunals specially constituted in that behalf and further lays down that all questions about the said right and liability shall be determined by the court or tribunals so empowered and vested with exclusive jurisdiction. Therefore, mere creation of a specific forum as a substitute for civil court or specifying the civil court, may not be enough to accept the inference of implicit non-arbitrability. Conferment of jurisdiction on a specific court or creation of a public forum though eminently significant, may not be the decisive test to answer and decide whether arbitrability is impliedly barred.\" [Emphasis supplied] What is crucial to notice is that this Court clearly emphasized that creation of a specific forum as a substitute for Civil Court or specifying the Civil Court may not be enough to accept the inference of implicit non-arbitrability. Conferment of jurisdiction on a specific court or creation of a public forum though eminently significant, may not be the decisive test to answer and decide whether arbitrability is impliedly barred. (d). Further for the completion of record, it is also mentioned herein that Vidya Drolia-II expressly overruled Himangni (supra) and held as under: - 18 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports \"79. Landlord-tenant disputes governed by the Transfer of Property Act are arbitrable as they are not actions in rem but pertain to subordinate rights in personam that arise from rights in rem. Such actions normally [Ed. : Certainly in those cases where the dispute only affects the parties to the arbitration clause, third-party rights would not be affected, as in the facts of the present case. It is in such cases that \"such actions under the TPA normally would not affect third-party rights or have erga omnes effect\". However, one may consider cases for instance, where a sub- tenancy exists or where the head lessee has taken a mortgage on the lease, and the landlord invokes the arbitration clause against the head lessee seeking to terminate the head lease, can the sub-tenant or mortgagee of the head lessee seek to be impleaded in the arbitration proceedings? For termination of the head lease would also extinguish the rights of the sub-tenant and the mortgagee of the head lessee. The situations posited are relatively simple ones. Often there are numerous prior and subsequent transferees who might be affected by the result of a dispute between a landlord and tenant, or even between other transferees. In such complex situations involving prior and subsequent transfers, it would appear that the matter would be non-arbitrable as it would appear to satisfy the first two tests of non-arbitrability laid down herein--see Shortnotes B and C. In a case where the mortgagee is covered by the RDB Act and the Sarfaesi Act, it might be rendered non-arbitrable by virtue of the fourth test as well--see Shortnotes E and G.] would not affect third-party rights or have erga omnes effect or require centralised adjudication. An award passed deciding landlord-tenant disputes can be executed and enforced like a decree of the civil court. Landlord-tenant disputes do not relate to inalienable and sovereign functions of the State. The provisions of the Transfer of Property Act do not expressly or by necessary implication bar arbitration.\n\n[2026] 1 S.C.R. 19 Motilal Oswal Financial Services Limited v. Santosh Cordeiro and Another The Transfer of Property Act, like all other Acts, has a public purpose, that is, to regulate landlord-tenant relationships and the arbitrator would be bound by the provisions, including provisions which enure and protect the tenants. 80. In view of the aforesaid, we overrule the ratio laid down in Himangni Enterprises [Himangni Enterprises v. Kamaljeet Singh Ahluwalia, (2017) 10 SCC 706 : (2018) 1 SCC (Civ) 82] and hold that landlord-tenant disputes are arbitrable as the Transfer of Property Act does not forbid or foreclose arbitration. However, landlord-tenant disputes covered and governed by rent control legislation would not be arbitrable when specific court or forum has been given exclusive jurisdiction to apply and decide special rights and obligations. Such rights and obligations can only be adjudicated and enforced by the specified court/forum, and not through arbitration.\" III. Thirdly, if in this context, Section 41 is appreciated, it will be clear that Section 41 is a provision conferring jurisdiction on the Small Causes Court for certain types of disputes and cannot be interpreted to mean that ex proprio vigore (by its own force), it neutralizes arbitration clauses in agreements. IV. Fourthly, Arbitration clauses have their roots in Section 28 of the Contract Act, 1872, a provision completely missed in Central Warehousing (Supra). Section 28 which speaks of agreements in restraint of legal proceeding being void, has two important exceptions. Relevant part of Section 28 and exceptions are extracted hereinbelow. \"28. Agreements in restraint of legal proceedings, void.-- Every agreement,-- (a) by which any party thereto is restricted absolutely from enforcing his rights under or in respect of any contract, by the usual legal proceedings in the ordinary tribunals, or which limits the time within which he may thus enforce his rights; or (b) which extinguishes the rights of any party thereto, or discharges any party thereto, from any liability, under or in respect of any contract on 20 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports the expiry of a specified period so as to restrict any party from enforcing his rights, is void to the extent.\" Exception 1.--Saving of contract to refer to arbitration dispute that may arise.--This section shall not render illegal a contract, by which two or more persons agree that any dispute which may arise between them in respect of any subject or class of subjects shall be referred to arbitration, and that only the amount awarded in such arbitration shall be recoverable in respect of the dispute so referred. Exception 2.- Saving of contract to refer questions that have already arisen.- Nor shall this section render illegal any contract in writing, by which two or more persons agree to refer to arbitration any question between them which has already arisen, or affect any provision of any law in force for the time being as to references to arbitration.\" It will be clear that when two or more persons agree to refer a matter to arbitration, Section 28 will not render that agreement invalid. 22. Considerable arguments were advanced both in the oral submissions and in the written note about whether the nature of the claim is in the form of debt or whether it pertains to a matter covered by the ambit of Section 41(1). Arguments were also advanced on the issue as to how the dispute between the parties is a dispute in personam (as contended by the respondent) pertaining only to the recovery of a debt as opposed to the appellant contending that it is a dispute relating to the recovery of the license fee or charges or rent, covered under Section 41(1) of the 1882 Act. Reliance was placed on Natraj Studios (supra) and Booz Allen (supra) by the appellant and Globsport (supra) by the respondents. 23. In exercise of our jurisdiction under Section 11, we are not concerned with the said dispute. That will be for the arbitrator to decide. We have been told that the Arbitrator has taken a decision on the Section 16 application. If that be so, parties have to work out their remedies in accordance with law. As and when such remedies are resorted to, they will be decided uninfluenced by any of the observations made herein. All questions between the parties other than the one answered herein based on Section 11(6-A) of the A&C Act are left open.\n\n[2026] 1 S.C.R. 21 Motilal Oswal Financial Services Limited v. Santosh Cordeiro and Another 24. Section 16 of the A&C Act reads as under: - \"16. Competence of arbitral tribunal to rule on its jurisdiction.--(1) The arbitral tribunal may rule on its own jurisdiction, including ruling on any objections with respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement, and for that purpose,-- (a) an arbitration clause which forms part of a contract shall be treated as an agreement independent of the other terms of the contract; and (b) a decision by the arbitral tribunal that the contract is null and void shall not entail ipso jure the invalidity of the arbitration clause. (2) A plea that the arbitral tribunal does not have jurisdiction shall be raised not later than the submission of the statement of defence; however, a party shall not be precluded from raising such a plea merely because that he has appointed, or participated in the appointment of, an arbitrator. (3) A plea that the arbitral tribunal is exceeding the scope of its authority shall be raised as soon as the matter alleged to be beyond the scope of its authority is raised during the arbitral proceedings. (4) The arbitral tribunal may, in either of the cases referred to in sub-section (2) or sub-section (3), admit a later plea if it considers the delay justified. (5) The arbitral tribunal shall decide on a plea referred to in sub-section (2) or sub-section (3) and, where the arbitral tribunal takes a decision rejecting the plea, continue with the arbitral proceedings and make an arbitral award. (6) A party aggrieved by such an arbitral award may make an application for setting aside such an arbitral award in accordance with section 34.\" 25. In re Interplay (supra), this Court held as follows: - \"123. The doctrine of kompetenz-kompetenz (also known as competence-competence), as originally developed 22 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports in Germany, was traditionally understood to imply that arbitrators are empowered to make a final ruling on their own jurisdiction, with no subsequent judicial review of the decision by any court. [ Fouchard, Gaillard, Goldman on International Commercial Arbitration, Emmanuel Gaillard and John Savage (Eds.), (1999) 396.] However, many jurisdictions allow an Arbitral Tribunal to render a decision on its jurisdiction, subject to substantive judicial review. [Gary Born, International Arbitration Law and Practice (3rd Edn., 2021) 1143.] 124. It is a well-recognised principle of public international law that a legal authority possessing adjudicatory powers has the right to decide its own jurisdiction. [Interpretation of the Greco-Turkish Agreement of December 1st, 1926, In re, 1928 SCC OnLine PCIJ 5] Similarly, it is a general rule of international arbitration law that an Arbitral Tribunal has the power to determine its own jurisdiction. The ability of an Arbitral Tribunal to determine its own jurisdiction is an important facet of arbitration jurisprudence because it gives effect to the separability presumption. The separability presumption insulates the arbitration agreement from the defects of the underlying contract, and thereby ensures the sustenance of the tribunal's jurisdiction over the substantive rights and obligations of the parties under the underlying contract even after such a contract is put to an end. The doctrine of competence-competence allows the tribunal to decide on all substantive issues arising out of the underlying contract, including the existence and validity of the arbitration agreement.\" 26. For the reasons set out hereinabove, paragraph 40 of Central Warehousing (Supra) cannot be understood on the facts of the present case to mean that Clause 33 of the Leave and License Agreement has ceased to exist. 27. We have been constrained to deal with the judgement in Central Warehousing (supra) only to decipher whether on account of the said judgement, Clause 33 of the Leave and License Agreement dated 06.10.2017, in the present case, containing the arbitration clause is non-existent. We hold that it is not and that an examination under Section 11(6-A) indicates that there exists an arbitration agreement\n\n[2026] 1 S.C.R. 23 Motilal Oswal Financial Services Limited v. Santosh Cordeiro and Another between the parties. We are conscious that an appeal is pending in this Court against the judgement in Central Warehousing (supra). That appeal may be decided on its own merits and we are not to be taken to have pronounced on the correctness of Central Warehousing (supra) one way or the other. 28. The appeal is dismissed for the reasons stated above. No order as to costs. The Arbitrator shall proceed with the adjudication of the disputes and conclude the proceedings within 6 months from today. Result of the case: Appeal dismissed. †Headnotes prepared by: Divya Pandey", "2026_1_206_226_EN_2026": "[2026] 1 S.C.R. 206 : 2026 INSC 32 Regenta Hotels Private Limited v.

M/s Hotel Grand Centre Point and Others rigor of r.9(4), 2001 Rules is not applicable to the Appellant - The date on which the respondent receives a notice or request invoking arbitration is the moment at which the arbitral proceedings commence u/s.21 - A valid invocation requires the notice to articulate the dispute sought to be referred but once such notice is received, commencement is complete and effective for all legal purposes including limitation, maintainability of the s.11 Petition and the legal efficacy of any pre-arbitral measures - Trial Court passed the Order dtd.17.02.2024 granting ad-interim injunction to the Appellant - Period of ninety days as provided u/s.9(2) would end on 17.05.2024 - Appellant served a notice invoking arbitration on 11.04.2024 - Reply of Respondent No.2 dtd.23.04.2024 refusing to join in the appointment of an arbitrator entails that notice had indeed been received and understood as an invocation of the arbitral process by the Respondent No.2 - Even if 23.04.2024, the date on which the reply sent by the Respondent No.2, is taken to calculate the period of ninety days, as stipulated u/s.9(2) and the consequences thereof provided u/r.9(4), 2001 Rules, the arbitral proceedings have commenced well within the time and way before expiry of such periods - High Court treated the date of filing of the s.11 petition i.e. 28.06.2024 as the date of commencement of the arbitral proceedings resulting into the finding that ad-interim stay stood vacated and proceedings commenced after the expiry of ninety days period provided u/s.9(2) - This finding is not sustainable as it is contrary to the objective and purpose of the Act - Impugned Judgment of the High Court unsustainable, set aside - Order of the Trial Court dtd.01.10.2024 vacating the ad-interim injunction also set aside, restoring the earlier Order dtd.17.02.2024 [Paras 22, 28, 31 ] Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 - s.21: Held: The commencement of arbitral proceedings is a statutory event defined exclusively u/s.21, wherein the respondent's receipt of a request to refer the dispute to arbitration sets the arbitral proceedings in motion and no judicial application i.e. whether u/s.9 or s.11 petition, constitutes commencement - Therefore, the statutory consequences tied to commencement, including the mandate u/s.9(2), must be assessed solely with reference to the date of receipt of request invoking arbitration u/s.21. [Para 23] Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 - s.21 - Purpose of, explained. [Para 29] 208 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 - s.21 - Conscious delinking of the commencement of arbitral proceedings from any judicial proceedings based on the UNCITRAL framework: Held: The very frame of s.21 provides that the Legislature has consciously delinked the commencement of arbitral proceedings from any judicial proceedings - This is a deliberate legislative choice modelled on the UNCITRAL framework, meant to ensure that the commencement of arbitral proceedings is clear and independent of procedural contingencies - The objective of this statutory scheme would be defeated if a court is permitted to substitute the date of commencement u/s.21 with the date of filing a s.11 petition - Resort to the proceedings u/s.11 would be necessitated only in case there is refusal or no response to the notice u/s.21 - High Court proceeded on the premise that since the petition u/s.11 was filed on 28.06.2024, beyond three months from the date of ad-interim Order dtd.17.02.2024, the arbitral proceedings had not commenced within time - This view rests on a misconception regarding the statutory scheme - Article 21 of the Model Law of UNCITRAL. [Para 28] Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 - ss.9(2), 21 - Rationale underlying s.9(2), discussed - If the commencement is to be construed from the date of filing of the petition u/s.11, the statutory scheme insisting on expedition in commencing arbitration after the grant of interim protection u/s.9 would be rendered incoherent - The applicant could serve notice u/s.21 but still be held non-compliant until a s.11 petition is filed, an interpretation which would be directly in contrast with the object and purpose of the Act - Permitting such an interpretation would mean that the parties would paradoxically be required to file the s.11 petition to prevent the lapse of interim measures granted u/s.9 even when the respondent is cooperating, the contractual appointment procedure is underway, or even when the s.21 notice has only recently been served - This is antithetical to the flexibility and autonomy provided in the Act. [Para 30] Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 - ss.21, 9(2) - In absence of any other provision providing for the date of commencement of the arbitral proceedings, s.21 is to apply to all the provisions of the Act unless specifically provided otherwise - Plea of the Respondent No.2 that the commencement u/s.21 is only for the purpose of calculating limitation u/s.43(2): [2026] 1 S.C.R. 209 Regenta Hotels Private Limited v. M/s Hotel Grand Centre Point and Others Held: Not accepted - s.21 explicitly provides that arbitral proceedings commence on the date on which a request for dispute to be referred to arbitration is received by the respondent - In absence of any other provision providing for the date of commencement of the arbitral proceedings, s.21 is to be construed to apply to all the provisions of the Act unless specifically provided as not applicable - The only exception that is carved out in s.21 pertains to the arbitral agreement itself, providing that unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the date of commencement of arbitral proceedings must be from the date when notice or request invoking arbitration is received by the respondent - Therefore, as per the mandate of s.9(2), the arbitration proceedings shall commence within a period of ninety days from the date of such interim order or within such further time as the court may determine, and such commencement will be the date on which notice invoking arbitration is received by the respondent in consonance of s.21.

Judgment / Order of the Supreme Court Judgment Augustine George Masih, J. Leave granted. 2. The instant Civil Appeal assails the Judgment dated 14.11.2024 (\"Impugned Judgment\") passed by the High Court of Karnataka at Bengaluru (\"High Court\"), whereby it dismissed the Miscellaneous First Appeal No. 7168 of 2024 (AA) filed by the Appellant herein against the Order dated 01.10.2024 of the IXth Additional City Civil and Sessions Judge, Bengaluru (\"Trial Court\") in I.A. Nos. 5 to 7 in AA No. 4 of 2024 which has been filed under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 read with Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (\"CPC 1908\") and Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (\"Act\") read with Rule 9 of the Arbitration (Proceedings Before [2026] 1 S.C.R. 211 Regenta Hotels Private Limited v. M/s Hotel Grand Centre Point and Others the Courts) Rules, 2001 (\"2001 Rules\"). The Trial Court vide Order dated 01.10.2024 dismissed the application seeking temporary injunction restraining Respondent No.2. 3. The Appellant herein is Regenta Hotels Private Limited, a company registered under the Companies Act, 1956, engaged in carrying business, inter alia, of operating hotels and providing hospitality services in India and abroad. The Respondent No. 1 is M/s Hotel Grand Centre Point, a partnership firm registered under the Partnership Act, 1932. Respondents No.2 to 5 are brothers and partners of Respondent No.1 vide partnership agreement entered on 01.04.2012, with each brother having 25% share in the partnership. Respondent No.1 is owner of a hotel premises located near Hatrick Restaurant, Raj Bagh, Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir (\"Hotel\"). 4. The abovementioned parties i.e., the Appellant and Respondent No.1 entered into a Franchise Agreement dated 23.03.2019. The terms of the agreement were such that the Appellant would aid and facilitate the business of Respondent No.1 by contributing through its brand reputation, technical know-how, training and expertise in running premium quality hotel businesses. In furtherance thereto, the management and operations of Respondent No.1 were being carried out as per the said agreement. 5. Interregnum, the Respondents No. 2 to 5 were involved in a family dispute over rights on properties resulting into a settlement deed dated 20.04.2022 providing that Respondent No. 5 will be responsible for operations of the Hotel for a period of two years and after the expiry of said period, the Hotel operation shall be conducted by such party who shall be nominated by the parties by voting. Profits of the Hotel were decided to be shared by Respondent No. 2 in the ratio of 25% and Respondent No. 5 in the ratio of 33.50% as also to include every month consideration for his responsibility to operate the Hotel. The remaining share was to be divided among Respondent No. 3 and 4 in the ratio of 21.50% and 20% respectively. 6. As transpires from the material on record, it is alleged that Respondent No.2 started to interfere in the functioning of the Hotel by shouting at staff and threatening to cancel bookings and taking away the records if not paid exorbitant sums separately over and above the agreed amount under the Franchise Agreement dated 23.03.2019. As a consequence to the alleged conduct of Respondent No. 2, 212 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports the Appellant on 16.02.2024 approached the Trial Court by way of an application under Section 9 of the Act being AA No.4 of 2024 seeking various injunctive reliefs to restrain the Respondent No.2 from interfering with the smooth functioning of the Hotel claiming that Clause 5.1 of the Franchise Agreement stipulates that Respondent No.1 will maintain a high moral and ethical standard and atmosphere at the Hotel premises. The Appellant also filed three applications being IA No.5 to 7 seeking interim reliefs to restrain Respondent No.2 from obstructing or impeding in smooth functioning, operations and management of the Hotel pending disposal of AA No.4 of 2024. 7. The Trial Court vide Order dated 17.02.2024 granted ad-interim injunction against the Respondent No.2 as prayed for in IA No.5 to 7 till next date of the hearing and issued notice to the Respondents. 8. Thereafter, the Appellant on 11.04.2024 issued an Arbitration notice to the Respondents invoking arbitration in terms of Clause 19.1 of the Franchise Agreement for the adjudication of the disputes that have arisen between the parties. The Respondent No. 2, in response to the said notice dated 11.04.2024, sent a reply on 23.04.2024 refusing to concur with the nomination of the Arbitrator claiming that he has not signed any Franchise Agreement with the Appellant. The Appellant, on 28.06.2024 filed CMP No.314 of 2024 under Section 11(6) of Act before the High Court seeking appointment of sole Arbitrator and for referring the parties to arbitration under the Franchise Agreement dated 23.03.2019. 9. The Respondent No.2 has filed written statement before Trial Court in AA No. 4 of 2024 denying allegations and contended that the suit itself is not maintainable claiming that Respondent No.2 is not a signatory to the Franchise Agreement. He contested that Respondent No.5 is not allowing Respondent No.2 to inspect the books of accounts, ledgers or bills etc. 10. The Trial Court vide Order dated 01.10.2024 dismissed IA Nos.5 to 7 filed by the Appellant with the observation that the Appellant failed to produce any document demonstrating that Respondent No.2 granted consent for the contested Franchise Agreement, thereby failing to establish a prima facie case or the balance of convenience in its favour. It was further stated that AA No.4 of 2024 was filed on 16.02.2024, and more than six and a half months had elapsed without the Appellant producing any document except for the notice [2026] 1 S.C.R. 213 Regenta Hotels Private Limited v. M/s Hotel Grand Centre Point and Others and reply for initiation of arbitral proceedings as mandated after filing an application under Section 9 of the Act nor was any substantive material produced to satisfy the requirements under Section 21 of the said Act, as Respondent No.2 had not agreed to refer the dispute to arbitration. The Trial Court also observed that all partners held equal rights under the partnership deed and must obtain mutual written consent for any substantive decision or agreement. 11. This Order dated 01.10.2024 was challenged by the Appellant in Miscellaneous First Appeal No. 7168 of 2024 (AA) before the High Court. The High Court vide Impugned Judgment dismissed the appeal holding that Section 9(2) of the Act read with Rule 9(4) of the 2001 Rules mandate that arbitral proceedings must commence within 90 days or three months from the date of an interim order or presentation of the Section 9 application, failing which any interim relief granted stands vacated automatically. The High Court reiterated that arbitral proceedings commence only when a request for reference to arbitration is received by the respondent, and mere issuance of notice does not constitute such commencement. The petition under Section 11 of Act was filed on 28.06.2024 which was beyond the permissible period, as arbitral proceedings ought to have been initiated by 17.05.2024. The High Court, however, rejected the contention of the Respondent No. 2 that he is not a signatory to Franchise Agreement and noted that the Trial Court erred in relying upon clauses of the partnership deed to conclude absence of a prima facie case or existence of Franchise Agreement dated 23.03.2019 as the same evidenced consent among partners and was acted upon as the Hotel kept running as per agreement and the partners kept quiet from 2019 to 2023. The High Court nevertheless upheld the dismissal of the Appellant's application, holding that failure to initiate arbitration within 90 days rendered the interim order unsustainable, and issuance of notice alone could not be construed as commencement of arbitration. 12. It would not be out of way to mention here that the above finding of High Court with respect to the existence of the Franchise Agreement dated 23.03.2019 has not been challenged by the Respondent No.2. It is only the Appellant being aggrieved by the dismissal of the Appeal by the High Court on the ground of arbitration proceedings having not commenced within 90 days from the date of ad-interim injunction, is before this Court. 214 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports 13. This Court, on 17.12.2024, while issuing notice to the Respondents had granted interim injunction in terms of Order dated 17.02.2024 of the Trial Court and continued it till the disposal of the Appeal. 14. The learned counsel for the Appellant submits that the arbitration proceedings commence on the date of receipt of notice given under Section 21 of the Act unless parties agree otherwise. The phrase commencement is defined under Section 21 of the Act, and it is also used in Section 9, 43(2) and 85(2) of the Act. In all these contexts, this Court has held that it is the date of receipt of notice under Section 21 that is determinative of the commencement of arbitration proceedings. Reliance is placed on Sundaram Finance Ltd. v. NEPC India Ltd.1, Arif Azim Company Limited v. Aptech Limited2, Milkfood Ltd. v. GMC Ice Cream (P) Ltd.3, Geo Miller and Company Private Limited v. Chairman, Rajasthan Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Limited4. He submits that the dispute between the brothers, who are partners of the Respondent No.1, have no bearing on the Franchise Agreement and in any case, it has been decided in favour of the Appellant by the High Court by the Impugned Judgment which has not been challenged by the Respondents either by filing an appeal or by cross-objections. The learned counsel further submits that the Respondent No.2 and other partners suppressed an agreement dated 09.10.2025 entered into between them by which they have decided to close the hotel in violation of this Court's interim order dated 17.12.2024. 15. The learned counsel for the Respondent No.2 submits that the Appellant's right in the management of the Hotel is limited to getting royalty payment of 5% each month along with taxes, while the Respondent No.1 retains and exercises direct management and control over the day-to-day operations of the Hotel, which was the duty Respondent No.5 has undertaken and despite completion of two years has not stepped down. The Respondent No.5 has not taken written consent of all the partners while signing the Franchise Agreement on behalf of the Respondent No.1. He submits that Section 21 of 1 (1999) 2 SCC 479 2 (2024) 5 SCC 313 3 (2004) 7 SCC 288 4 (2020) 14 SCC 643 [2026] 1 S.C.R. 215 Regenta Hotels Private Limited v. M/s Hotel Grand Centre Point and Others the Act is a deeming provision whereby the date of commencement of arbitral proceedings relates back to the date on which the notice invoking arbitration was received. Section 43(2) of the Act provides that an arbitration is deemed to have commenced from the date referred in Section 21 of the Act. Reliance is placed on State of Goa v. Praveen Enterprises5, contending that the primary object of Section 21 of the Act is to determine the date of commencement of the arbitral proceedings to decide if claims were ex-facie time barred. The learned counsel further submits that \"commencement\" in Section 21 is not for the purpose of Section 9(2) of the Act but for Section 43, which explicitly mentions Section 21. 16. Having heard the learned counsels for the parties and upon perusal of material on record, it emerges that the finding as returned by the High Court with regard to the existence of Franchise Agreement dated 23.03.2019 is not challenged by the Respondent No.2 by way of cross-objection in this appeal nor is there any material on record to show that any other petition is filed in this regard. The said finding has thus attained finality to the effect that the consent of Respondent No.2 was there to the Franchise Agreement. 16(A). The only issue which concerns the present Appeal is whether the High Court was correct in holding that the Appellant has initiated arbitral proceedings after the expiry of 90 days period as prescribed under Section 9(2) of the Act, thereby resulting in automatic vacation of ad-interim injunction in terms of Rule 9(4) of the 2001 Rules. 17. Before delving into the jurisprudential foundation governing the commencement of the arbitral proceedings under the Act, let us reproduce the relevant provisions of the Act for convenience. 18. Sections 9, 21 and 43(2) of Act read as follows: \"9. Interim measures, etc., by Court.--(1) A party may, before or during arbitral proceedings or at any time after the making of the arbitral award but before it is enforced in accordance with section 36, apply to a court-- 5 (2012) 12 SCC 581\n\n216 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports (i) for the appointment of a guardian for a minor or a person of unsound mind for the purposes of arbitral proceedings; or (ii) for an interim measure of protection in respect of any of the following matters, namely:-- (a) the preservation, interim custody or sale of any goods which are the subject-matter of the arbitration agreement; (b) securing the amount in dispute in the arbitration; (c) the detention, preservation or inspection of any property or thing which is the subject-matter of the dispute in arbitration, or as to which any question may arise therein and authorising for any of the aforesaid purposes any person to enter upon any land or building in the possession of any party, or authorising any samples to be taken or any observation to be made, or experiment to be tried, which may be necessary or expedient for the purpose of obtaining full information or evidence; (d) interim injunction or the appointment of a receiver; (e) such other interim measure of protection as may appear to the Court to be just and convenient, and the Court shall have the same power for making orders as it has for the purpose of, and in relation to, any proceedings before it. (2) Where, before the commencement of the arbitral proceedings, a Court passes an order for any interim measure of protection under sub-section (1), the arbitral proceedings shall be commenced within a period of ninety days from the date of such order or within such further time as the Court may determine. (3) Once the arbitral tribunal has been constituted, the Court shall not entertain an application under sub-section (1), unless the Court finds that circumstances exist which [2026] 1 S.C.R. 217 Regenta Hotels Private Limited v. M/s Hotel Grand Centre Point and Others may not render the remedy provided under section 17 efficacious. 21. Commencement of arbitral proceedings.--Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the arbitral proceedings in respect of a particular dispute commence on the date on which a request for that dispute to be referred to arbitration is received by the respondent. 43. Limitations.--(1) . . . (2) For the purposes of this section and the Limitation Act, 1963 (36 of 1963), an arbitration shall be deemed to have commenced on the date referred in section 21.\" 19. The jurisprudential foundation governing the commencement of arbitral proceedings under the Act stands on a principled and consistent line of authority emanating from this Court. In Sundaram Finance Ltd. (supra), this Court, while dealing with the issue as to whether a court has jurisdiction to pass interim orders under Section 9 of the Act even before the arbitral proceedings commence, has observed that reading of Section 21 of the Act clearly shows that the arbitral proceedings commence on the date on which a request for a dispute to be referred to arbitration is received by the respondent. 20. The contours of this principle were later given sharper precision in Milkfood Ltd. (supra), wherein a three-Judge Bench of this Court held that the Legislature has deliberately adopted the UNCITRAL Model Law's formulation, whereby the arbitral proceedings commence upon respondent's receipt of a request or notice that the dispute be referred to arbitration. The provisions under Section 21 of the Act are consistent with Article 21 of the Model Law of UNCITRAL. The Court further observed that the issuance of notice under Section 21 is required to be interpreted broadly and not for the purpose of limitation only but for other purposes also. 21. In Geo Miller (supra), this Court reaffirmed the principles of Milkfood Ltd. (supra), holding that for the purpose of determining which law applies or for computing limitation, the date of commencement is invariably the date on which the notice invoking arbitration is received by the respondent. The Court clarified that the procedural route adopted thereafter i.e., whether the parties agree on an arbitrator or whether a Section 11 petition becomes necessary, is irrelevant\n\n218 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports to the date of commencement, which remains tethered exclusively to Section 21 of the Act. 22. In Arif Azim (supra), a three-Judge Bench of this Court has consolidated and restated what is being held in Milkfood Ltd. (supra) and Geo Miller (supra). The Court re-emphasized that the date on which the respondent receives a notice or request invoking arbitration is the moment at which the arbitral proceedings commence under Section 21 of the Act. It further clarified that a valid invocation requires the notice to articulate the dispute sought to be referred but once such notice is received, commencement is complete and effective for all legal purposes including limitation, maintainability of the Section 11 Petition and the legal efficacy of any pre-arbitral measures. The relevant portion in paras 88 to 91, are reproduced herein: \"88. Section 21 of the 1996 Act provides that the arbitral proceedings in relation to a dispute commence when a notice invoking arbitration is sent by the claimant to the other party: '21. Commencement of arbitral proceedings.-- Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the arbitral proceedings in respect of a particular dispute commence on the date on which a request for that dispute to be referred to arbitration is received by the respondent.' 89. In Milkfood Ltd. v. GMC Ice Cream (P) Ltd. [(2004) 7 SCC 288] , it was observed thus : (SCC pp. 301-302 & 307, paras 26-27, 29 & 49) '26. The commencement of an arbitration proceeding for the purpose of applicability of the provisions of the Indian Limitation Act is of great significance. Even Section 43(1) of the 1996 Act provides that the Limitation Act, 1963 shall apply to the arbitration as it applies to proceedings in court. Sub-section (2) thereof provides that for the purpose of the said section and the Limitation Act, 1963, an arbitration shall be deemed to have commenced on the date referred to in Section 21. [2026] 1 S.C.R. 219 Regenta Hotels Private Limited v. M/s Hotel Grand Centre Point and Others 27. Article 21 of the Model Law which was modelled on Article 3 of the Uncitral Arbitration Rules had been adopted for the purpose of drafting Section 21 of the 1996 Act. Section 3 of the 1996 Act provides for as to when a request can be said to have been received by the respondent. Thus, whether for the purpose of applying the provisions of Chapter II of the 1940 Act or for the purpose of Section 21 of the 1996 Act, what is necessary is to issue/serve a request/notice to the respondent indicating that the claimant seeks arbitration of the dispute. *** 29. For the purpose of the Limitation Act an arbitration is deemed to have commenced when one party to the arbitration agreement serves on the other a notice requiring the appointment of an arbitrator. This indeed is relatable to the other purposes also, as, for example, see Section 29(2) of the (English) Arbitration Act, 1950. *** 49. Section 21 of the 1996 Act, as noticed hereinbefore, provides as to when the arbitral proceedings would be deemed to have commenced. Section 21 although may be construed to be laying down a provision for the purpose of the said Act but the same must be given its full effect having regard to the fact that the repeal and saving clause is also contained therein. Section 21 of the Act must, therefore, be construed having regard to Section 85(2)(a) of the 1996 Act. Once it is so construed, indisputably the service of notice and/or issuance of request for appointment of an arbitrator in terms of the arbitration agreement must be held to be determinative of the commencement of the arbitral proceeding.' 90. Similarly, in BSNL v. Nortel Networks (India) (P) Ltd. [(2021) 5 SCC 738], it was held by this Court thus: (SCC p. 766, para 51)\n\n220 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports '51. The period of limitation for issuing notice of arbitration would not get extended by mere exchange of letters, [S.S. Rathore v. State of M.P., (1989) 4 SCC 582 : 1990 SCC (L&S) 50; Union of India v. Har Dayal, (2010) 1 SCC 394; CLP (India) (P) Ltd. v. Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd., (2020) 5 SCC 185] or mere settlement discussions, where a final bill is rejected by making deductions or otherwise. Sections 5 to 20 of the Limitation Act do not exclude the time taken on account of settlement discussions. Section 9 of the Limitation Act makes it clear that: 'where once the time has begun to run, no subsequent disability or inability to institute a suit or make an application stops it'. There must be a clear notice invoking arbitration setting out the \"particular dispute\" [ Section 21 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.] (including claims/amounts) which must be received by the other party within a period of 3 years from the rejection of a final bill, failing which, the time bar would prevail.' 91. In the present case, the notice invoking arbitration was received by the respondent on 29-11-2022, which is within the three-year period from the date on which the cause of action for the claim had arisen. Thus, it cannot be said that the claims sought to be raised by the petitioner are ex facie time-barred or dead claims on the date of the commencement of arbitration.\" 23. Upon perusal of the binding decisions of this Court and provisions of the Act, there is no doubt left with regard to the correct conceptualization of \"commencement of arbitral proceedings\" under the Act. The settled position as emerged is that the commencement of arbitral proceedings is a statutory event defined exclusively under Section 21 of the Act, wherein the respondent's receipt of a request to refer the dispute to arbitration sets the arbitral proceedings in motion and no judicial application i.e. whether under Section 9 or Section 11 petition, constitutes commencement. Therefore, the statutory consequences tied to commencement, including the mandate under Section 9(2) of the Act, must be assessed solely with reference to the date of receipt of request invoking arbitration under Section 21 of the Act. [2026] 1 S.C.R. 221 Regenta Hotels Private Limited v. M/s Hotel Grand Centre Point and Others 24. The contention of the Respondent No.2 that the commencement under Section 21 of the Act is only for the purpose of calculating limitation under Section 43(2) of the Act does not find force with us. Section 21 explicitly provides that arbitral proceedings commence on the date on which a request for dispute to be referred to arbitration is received by the respondent. In absence of any other provision providing for the date of commencement of the arbitral proceedings, Section 21 is to be construed to apply to all the provisions of the Act unless specifically provided as not applicable. The only exception that is carved out in Section 21 pertains to the arbitral agreement itself, providing that unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the date of commencement of arbitral proceedings must be from the date when notice or request invoking arbitration is received by the respondent. Therefore, as per the mandate of Section 9(2) of the Act, the arbitration proceedings shall commence within a period of ninety days from the date of such interim order or within such further time as the court may determine, and such commencement will be the date on which notice invoking arbitration is received by the respondent in consonance of Section 21 of the Act. 25. At this stage, it requires to be mentioned that the consequences flowing from the non-compliance of mandate under Section 9(2) of the Act are not provided for in the said Act. To fill in this gap reference is required to be made at this juncture to Rule 9 of 2001 Rules framed by the High Court as per the powers conferred on it under Section 82 of the Act, which reads as follows: \"Rule 9. Application for interim measure, etc.-- (1) When an application is made for an interim measure, under Section 9 of the Act, the Court shall in all cases, except where it appears that the object of granting the interim measure would be defeated by the delay, before passing the interim order, direct notice of the application to be given to the opposite party: Provided that, where it is proposed to make an order by way of interim measure without giving notice of the application to the opposite party, the Court shall record the reasons for its opinion that the object of granting the interim measure would be defeated by delay, and require applicant.--\n\n222 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports (a) to deliver to the opposite party, or to sent to him by registered post, immediately after the order granting the interim measure has been made, a copy of the Application for interim order together with: (i) a copy of affidavit filed in support of the application; (ii) copies of documents on which the applicant relies; (b) to file, on the day on which such interim order is granted or on the day immediately following that day, an affidavit stating that the copies aforesaid have been so delivered or sent. (2) Where an interim order has been granted without giving notice to the opposite party, the Court shall make endeavours to finally dispose of the Application within thirty days from the date on which the interim order was granted and where it is unable so to do, it shall record its reasons for such inability. (3) In an application for interim measure filed under Section 9, before the commencement of the arbitral proceedings, the applicant shall specifically refer to the steps, if any, already taken to seek arbitration and that he is willing and prepared to take necessary steps with utmost expedition to seek reference to arbitration in terms of the Arbitration Agreement/Clause. (4) In the case of an application for interim measure made before initiating arbitral proceedings, if the arbitral proceedings are not initiated within three months from the date of the presentation of the Application under Section 9, any interim order granted shall stand vacated without any specific order being passed by the Court to that effect.\" 26. Upon the reading of Section 9 of the Act, it is evident that the said section does not provide for the consequences of non-compliance with its mandate of commencing arbitral proceedings within ninety days, however, the said vacuum stands statutorily filled through Rule 9(4) of the 2001 Rules. According to this Rule where an interim order has been granted on an application made under Section 9 of [2026] 1 S.C.R. 223 Regenta Hotels Private Limited v. M/s Hotel Grand Centre Point and Others the Act but no arbitral proceedings are initiated within three months from the date of presentation of the application, the interim order shall stand vacated automatically. 27. It requires to be noted and mentioned here that Rule 9(4) employs the expression \"initiated\" whereas Section 9(2) uses the expression \"commenced\" in the context of arbitral proceedings. As per Concise Oxford English Dictionary (Eleventh Edition, Revised), the term \"initiation\" connotes the act of causing something to begin or taking the first step towards beginning a process, whereas \"commencement\" denotes the actual beginning of the process itself, which is a step further than mere initiation. Thus, linguistically, initiation precedes commencement and as per Rule 9(4) the initiation shall be within three months from the date of presentation of such application, which would be before the commencement as per Section 21 of Act and would ideally be the date on which the notice invoking arbitration is sent by a party. However, the expression \"initiated\" occurring in Rule 9(4) cannot be interpreted in isolation or in a manner divorced from the statutory context in which it appears. Rule 9 has been framed in aid of, and to give procedural effect to, Section 9 of the Act, and therefore the terminology employed therein must be construed harmoniously with the parent provision. If \"initiation\" in Rule 9(4) were to be understood as something short of \"commencement\" as contemplated under Section 21 of the Act, the mandate under Section 9(2) prescribing a strict timeline for commencement of arbitral proceedings would be rendered otiose and susceptible to circumvention. Consequently, for the purposes of Rule 9(4), the expression \"initiated\" has necessarily to be read as \"commenced\" within the meaning of Section 21 of the Act. It follows that upon failure to commence arbitral proceedings within three months, the period stipulated under Rule 9(4) of 2001 Rules attracts the consequence as provided therein, namely, the interim order shall stand vacated automatically. 28. In the case at hand, the High Court proceeded on the premise that since the petition under Section 11 was filed on 28.06.2024, beyond three months from the date of ad-interim Order dated 17.02.2024, the arbitral proceedings had not commenced within time. This view of the High Court rests on a misconception regarding the statutory scheme. The very frame of Section 21 provides that the Legislature has consciously delinked the commencement of arbitral proceedings from any judicial proceedings. This Court, in Milkfood Ltd. (supra) 224 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports described this as a deliberate legislative choice modelled on the UNCITRAL framework, meant to ensure that the commencement of arbitral proceedings is clear and independent of procedural contingencies. The objective of this statutory scheme would be defeated if a court is permitted to substitute the date of commencement under Section 21 with the date of filing a Section 11 petition. Resort to the proceedings under Section 11 would be necessitated only in case there is refusal or no response to the notice under Section 21 of the Act. 29. The High Court in the Impugned Judgment conflates the trigger for arbitral proceedings with remedial mechanism made available when the respondent obstructs or declines to participate. The purpose of Section 21 is to specify the date of commencement of arbitral proceedings in order to determine whether a claim is barred by limitation and whether a party has complied with the requisite statutory or contractual time limit for initiation of arbitration. If the date of filing of the Section 11 petition is to be treated as the date of commencement of arbitral proceedings, as has been observed by the High Court in the Impugned Judgment, that would result into the displacement of commencement of arbitral proceedings as provided under Section 21 and would be contrary to the text and purpose of the Act. Such a position is impermissible as has been consistently held in the dicta of this Court from the decision in Sundaram Finance Ltd. (supra) to that in Arif Azim (supra). 30. The rationale underlying Section 9(2) of the Act is that the arbitral proceedings shall be commenced within ninety days from the grant of interim protection. This prevents a party from abusing Section 9 to obtain interim protection without submitting to the arbitral forum and it also ensures that interim measures remain tied to the arbitration they are meant to support. If this safeguard is interpreted in a manner that contradicts the statutory definition of the commencement, to do so would allow courts to rewrite Section 21 sub silentio. If the commencement is to be construed from the date of filing of the petition under Section 11 of the Act, the statutory scheme insisting on expedition in commencing arbitration after the grant of interim protection under Section 9 would be rendered incoherent. The applicant could serve notice under Section 21 but still be held non- compliant until a Section 11 petition is filed, an interpretation which would be directly in contrast with the object and purpose of the Act. [2026] 1 S.C.R. 225 Regenta Hotels Private Limited v. M/s Hotel Grand Centre Point and Others Permitting such an interpretation would mean that the parties would paradoxically be required to file the Section 11 petition to prevent the lapse of interim measures granted under Section 9 of the Act even when the respondent is cooperating, the contractual appointment procedure is underway, or even when the Section 21 notice has only recently been served. This is antithetical to the flexibility and autonomy provided in the Act. 31. The legal position as settled when applied to the present factual matrix yields a clear conclusion. The Trial Court passed the Order dated 17.02.2024 granting ad-interim injunction to the Appellant. The period of ninety days as provided under Section 9(2) of the Act would end on 17.05.2024. The Appellant served a notice invoking arbitration on 11.04.2024. The reply of Respondent No. 2 dated 23.04.2024 refusing to join in the appointment of an arbitrator entails that notice had indeed been received and understood as an invocation of the arbitral process by the Respondent No.2. Under Section 21 of the Act, the date of receipt of the notice is the date of commencement of arbitral proceedings. Even if 23.04.2024, the date on which the reply sent by the Respondent No.2, is taken to calculate the period of ninety days, as stipulated under Section 9(2) of the Act and the consequences thereof provided under Rule 9(4) of the 2001 Rules, the arbitral proceedings have commenced well within the time and way before expiry of such periods. The High Court, however, in the Impugned Judgment treated the date of filing of the Section 11 petition i.e. 28.06.2024 as the date of commencement of the arbitral proceedings resulting into the finding that ad-interim stay stood vacated and proceedings commenced after the expiry of ninety days period provided under Section 9(2) of the Act. This finding of the High Court cannot sustain as it is contrary to the objective and purpose of the Act. The arbitral proceedings, as commenced by the Appellant, is well within the statutory time frame provided under Section 9(2) of the Act and the rigor of Rule 9(4) of the 2001 Rules cannot be attracted to the Appellant. 32. Therefore, in the light of the above discussion and perusal of material on record, the Impugned Judgment of the High Court is set aside for being unsustainable in law. As a consequence thereof, the Order dated 01.10.2024 of the Trial Court vacating the ad-interim injunction also stands set aside, restoring the earlier Order dated 17.02.2024.\n\n226 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports 33. Before parting, it is essential that we request the High Court to expeditiously decide the Section 11 petition filed by the Appellant for appointment of the arbitrator on its own merits and in accordance with law, if already not decided. Nothing stated in this judgment will influence or prejudice the arbitral process in any manner. 34. The appeal is allowed in the above terms. 35. As the appeal stands allowed, we would not like to proceed as of now with the Contempt Petition (C) No.189 of 2025 as filed by the appellant and the same is disposed of at this stage. 36. There shall be no order as to costs. 37. Pending application(s), if any, stand disposed of. Result of the case: Appeal allowed, Contempt Petition disposed of. †Headnotes prepared by: Divya Pandey", "2026_1_227_302_EN_2026": "[2026] 1 S.C.R. 227 : 2026 INSC 33 The Property Company (P) Ltd. v.

(ii) Provisions of the 1963 Act-provisions that lay down a prescribed period of limitation as well as ss.4 to 24 of the 1963 Act, would only apply to suits, applications or appeals, as the case may be, which are made under any law to 'courts' and not to those made before quasi-judicial bodies or tribunals, unless such quasi-judicial bodies or tribunals are specifically empowered in that regard. (iii) Power to extend time u/s.5 of the 1963 Act cannot be resorted to by statutory authorities, quasi-judicial bodies or tribunals, unless expressly indicated - When such authorities or bodies are deemed to be a court for certain limited or specified purposes, such a legal [2026] 1 S.C.R. 229 The Property Company (P) Ltd. v. Rohinten Daddy Mazda fiction must not be extended beyond the purpose for which the fiction was created so as to confer powers u/s.5 of the 1963 Act as well. (iv) Principles underlying s.14 of the 1963 Act could be applied to the provisions relating to quasi-judicial bodies, unless there is any express indication to the contrary in the wording and scheme of the said provision - However, there exists vital distinction between the principles underlying ss.5 and 14 of the 1963 Act respectively. (v) Differences between the principles underlying ss.5 and 14 of the 1963 Act respectively are, the exercise of a discretionary power vested in the courts and the mandatory provision independent of any exercise of discretion; \"sufficient cause\" which term by itself is subject to a good amount of elasticity and the well-defined conditions which must be met; and the extension of time and the exclusion of time. (vi) Principles underlying ss.5 and 14 of the 1963 Act respectively, cannot be analogously applied to proceedings before quasi-judicial bodies because in the former, the courts exercise their discretion in extending and more specifically, adjusting the prescribed period of limitation itself to create a fresh period of limitation - No entitlement as a matter of right arises vis-à-vis extension of time - Whereas, in the latter, the prescribed period of limitation remains intact, no delay is attributed to the litigant and the time during which the abortive proceeding was being prosecuted is expunged in the eyes of the law to place the litigant back or restore his position within the prescribed period of limitation wherein he is entitled to file the appeal or application, as the case may be, as a matter of right. (vii) Mechanism envisaged u/s.5 of the 1963 Act is proximally bound and tethered to the discretion with which a civil court is empowered and that u/s.14 of the 1963 Act is anchored on restoring the right of a litigant to institute an appeal or application, as the case may be, within the prescribed period of limitation - Both provisions work in the interest of the litigant and seek to further the cause of substantive justice, however, the kind and nature of the power exercised under the two provisions, as well as the mechanism envisaged therein, are quite distinct - Moreover, the principles underlying ss.5 and 14 of the 1963 Act respectively also stand on a different footing for the reason that when the legislature has intended to grant powers of extension of time, the same has been expressly indicated either through the manner in which the concerned provision is phrased (more often than not through a proviso) or by the adoption of the 230 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports Act, 1963 through a separate provision to the special law as a whole (akin to s.433 of the 2013, Act). (viii) Regn.44 of the CLB Regulations which saves the inherent power of the CLB would not enable the CLB to extend time for the filing of the appeal or the application itself, as the case may be. (ix) Savings provision in the Act, 1963-s.29(2), is of no relevance when the special or local law deals with a suit, appeal or application, as the case may be, which is to be filed before a quasi-judicial body - Question whether a certain provision in a special or a local law expressly excludes the provisions of s.4 to 24 of the Act, 1963 respectively arises only in pursuance of the savings provision u/s.29(2) of the Act, 1963 - As a natural corollary, if s.29(2) is, by itself, inapplicable to a particular case then there would be no need to look into or analyse whether there is any express exclusion. (x) Appeal u/s.58(3) of the Act, 2013 preferred before the CLB- quasi-judicial body are being dealt with, it cannot be said that the principles underlying s.5 of the Act, 1963 must be applied - s.29(2) of the Act, 1963 is, of no relevance and there arises no occasion to examine whether s.58(3) of the Act, 2013 \"expressly excludes\" the application of s.5 of the Act, 1963. (xi) Simpliciter limitation period prescribed u/s.58(3) of the Act, 2013 must not be read to be merely directory - Presence of any additional pre-emptory language in the form of \"but not thereafter\" or \"shall\" would not always be necessary to convey that the prescribed period is mandatory. (xii) s.433 of the Act, 2013 which empowers the NCLT and the NCLAT respectively to apply the provisions of the Act, 1963, as far as may be, to the proceedings and appeals before itself, cannot be borrowed to signify the existence of a similar power with respect to the CLB - Moreover, the remedy of the respondent was already time-barred before the coming into force of s.58(3) of the Act, 2013, let alone the coming into force of s.433 of the Act, 2013 - Hence, the change in law cannot enure to the benefit of the respondent. Thus, the High Court erred in dismissing the statutory appeal filed u/s.10F of the erstwhile Act and thereby, affirming the order of the CLB condoning the delay of 249 days in filing the appeal u/s.58(3) of the Act, 2013 - Order passed by the High Court set aside - Company Law Board Regulations, 1991 - Regn 44 - Companies Act, 1956 - s.10F.

No. 222/2016 (hereinafter, the \"impugned decision\"), by which the High Court dismissed the appeal filed by the appellant herein and thereby, affirmed the order passed by the Company Law Board, Kolkata Bench (hereinafter, the \"CLB\") in C.A. No. 81 of 2014, condoning the delay of 249 days in filing the appeal under Section 58(3) of the Companies Act, 2013 (hereinafter, \"the Act, 2013\")by the respondent herein. A. FACTUAL MATRIX 3. The Property Company (P) Ltd. (hereinafter, the \"appellant company\") is a private limited company having a total of 631 fully paid-up equity shares. Ms. Mehroo Mazda, the mother of Mr. Rohinten Daddy Mazda, (hereinafter, the \"respondent\"), is said to have been a shareholder, holding 20 shares of the appellant company (hereinafter, the \"subject shares\"). Ms. Mehroo Mazda had passed away on 22.07.1989, however, two years prior to her demise, she is said to [2026] 1 S.C.R. 235 The Property Company (P) Ltd. v. Rohinten Daddy Mazda have bequeathed the subject shares to the respondent through her last will and testament dated 19.06.1987. Eventually, the respondent is also said to have obtained a probate of her will on 30.11.1990. 4. Vide letter dated 01.03.2013, i.e., after a gap of about 23 years from the date of obtaining the probate, the respondent's advocate had sent a notice to the appellant company seeking registration of the transmission of the subject shares. However, within a period of two months, vide communication dated 30.04.2013, the appellant company had replied to the aforesaid notice and refused such registration. It is pertinent to note that, during this period, it was Section 111 of the erstwhile Companies Act, 1956 (hereinafter, the \"Erstwhile Act\") which was in force. Sub-sections (2) and (3) respectively of Section 111 stipulated that the person giving intimation of the transmission of shares may prefer an appeal against such refusal before the CLB, but that this must be done within a period of two months from the receipt of the notice of refusal from the company. The said period of two months lapsed on 30.06.2013 and the respondent failed to take any action in this regard within the prescribed time period. 5. It is the case of the respondent that on or about 09.07.2013, the respondent who is a resident of London and a practising barrister, came to Kolkata and had held a conference with his advocates as regards the approach to be taken in the matter at hand, amongst others. As per his advocate's advice, vide communication dated 18.07.2013, yet another request was said to have been made to the appellant company to register the transmission of the subject shares. This communication is said to have also informed that the respondent would initiate appropriate legal action if the registration was not carried forward with. Thereafter, on or about 23.07.2013, the respondent is said to have departed from Kolkata. 6. Meanwhile, the Act, 2013 had replaced the Erstwhile Act and was published in the Official Gazette on 30.08.2013. However, not all provisions came into force on the said date. The Act, 2013 was implemented in a phased manner. Several provisions of the Act, 2013 had been brought into effect on 12.09.2013 and Section 58 along with Section 59 (which corresponds to Sections 111 and 111A of the erstwhile Act respectively) were amongst these provisions. In other words, as on 12.09.2013, Section 111 and 111A of the erstwhile 236 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports Act respectively, ceased to have any effect and was replaced by the new Sections 58 and 59 of the Act, 2013 respectively. The same was clarified vide Circular No. 16 of 2013 dated 18.09.2013 issued by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Government of India. 7. It would be apposite to mention that the appellant company afforded no reply to the aforesaid second communication dated 18.07.2013 sent by the respondent's advocates. Thereafter, the respondent is said to have returned to India during the second week of December, 2013 and also have instructed his advocates to proceed with taking appropriate legal recourse before a competent court of law. 8. In pursuance of the same, after a period of about five months from the second communication i.e., on 12.12.2013, the respondent's advocate forwarded a copy of the petition filed under Section 111A of the Erstwhile Act to the appellant company and presented the same before the Bench Officer, CLB, on the very next day i.e., on 13.12.2013. However, it seems that certain defects, including that the erstwhile Sections 111 and 111A respectively, had been replaced by the new Sections 58 and 59 respectively, were identified and the Bench Officer vide letter dated 16.12.2013 requested the same to be addressed and rectified within a period of 15 days. 9. The respondent thought fit to file a fresh petition instead of rectifying the defects as aforesaid and therefore, a fresh appeal under Section 58 of the Act, 2013 was filed before the CLB on 07.02.2014. The same came to be numbered as C.P. No. 31 of 2014. In the aforesaid appeal, the respondent had prayed for the following reliefs: \"(a) An order may be passed directing the respondent company to register the transfer/transmission of 20 equity shares in favour of the petitioner within a period of ten days; (b) That an order may be passed to rectify the register of members of the respondent company and induct the same of the petitioner in place of the transferor in relation to the 20 shares in question and all benefits such as rights/bonus, etc. that have accrued thereupon since the date of purchase; (c) Such orders as to the cost as may be deemed appropriate by the Hon'ble Bench; (d) Such further directions as the Hon'ble Bench may be pleased to give;\" [2026] 1 S.C.R. 237 The Property Company (P) Ltd. v. Rohinten Daddy Mazda 10. Along with the aforesaid appeal, the respondent also filed an application bearing C.A. No. 81 of 2014 under Regulation 44 of the Company Law Board Regulations, 1991 (hereinafter, the \"CLB Regulations\") seeking the condonation of delay of 249 days in preferring the appeal under Section 58 of the Act, 2013. 11. Soon thereafter, on 04.03.2014, the appellant company filed an application praying to dismiss the C.P. No. 31 of 2014 as being barred under Order XXIII, Rule 1(4) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (hereinafter, the \"CPC\") more particularly because the previous petition filed by the respondent on 13.12.2013 as regards the same subject-matter, had been abandoned by the respondent. Vide order dated 09.01.2015, the CLB held that the subsequent petition filed on 07.02.2014 under Section 58 of the Act, 2013 was maintainable because the earlier petition remained unregistered and un-numbered and therefore, the respondent could not be said to have abandoned his claim in choosing to file a fresh petition/appeal. 12. Aggrieved by the aforesaid order of the CLB, the appellant company filed an appeal before the High Court and the same came to be dismissed vide order dated 26.02.2015. The order of dismissal was further affirmed by this Court vide order dated 03.08.2015. In short, the order of the CLB holding that the subsequent petition filed under Section 58 of the Act, 2013, was maintainable, attained finality. B. DECISION OF THE CLB 13. As far as the application made before the CLB for condonation of delay in filing the subsequent petition dated 07.02.2014 is concerned, the same was allowed vide order dated 27.05.2016 and the delay of 249 days was condoned. While allowing the aforesaid application, the CLB had observed the following: (i) First, that the delay of 249 days primarily occurred owing to the fact that the respondent stayed in London and also because the earlier petition/appeal dated 13.12.2013 was filed under Section 111A of the erstwhile Act, which provision had ceased to have any effect post 12.09.2013. (ii) Secondly, that the technical ground of delay in filing the company petition must not overshadow or come in the way of the registration of transmission of the subject shares despite the fact that probate was granted on 30.11.1990. 238 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports (iii) Thirdly, that reasonable steps were taken by the respondent from the 2013 onwards to get the shares registered and in the interests of justice, the delay should be condoned. (iv) Lastly, considerable weight seems to have been placed on the fact that the underlying Company Petition bearing C.P. No. 31 of 2014 had been held to be maintainable and that the same was also affirmed by this Court. The relevant observations are reproduced hereinbelow: \"5.1 Under the aforesaid facts and circumstances, it is clear that the Petitioner appears to have remained silent from 1990 till the beginning of 2013 and there is no explanation as to such inaction on the part of the petitioner for making request to the Respondent Company for transmission of 20 shares in his favour based on the probate of Will dated 30.11.1990. However, on 12.09.2013, new Section 58 of the Companies Act, 2013 has become effective and hence, the Petitioner was under obligation to initiate action for filing the Petition under Section 58 of the Companies Act, 2013 within the permissible time. However, due to his stay in London and procedural discussions/conferences and also, the Company Petition wrongly filed under section 111A of the Companies Act, 1956, delay has occurred for 249 days. Here, it is relevant to highlight that the Company petition has been held maintainable by this Hon'ble Board vide order dated 09.01.2015 in the matter of C.A. No.167/2014. Apart from this, it is also viewed that merely the technical ground of delay of 249 days in filing the petition should not come in the way of transmission of shares despite probate of Will. Therefore, in the broader perspective, I am of the considered opinion that the Petitioner has taken reasonable steps at least from 2013 onwards and the 20 shares under transmission need to be represented by the legal representative of the deceased member of the Company. As such, for the ends of justice, I hereby condone the delay of 249 days in filing the Company Petition No. 31 of 2014.\" C. THE IMPUGNED DECISION 14. It is pertinent to note that Section 434 of the Act, 2013 had come into force with effect from 01.06.2016 and sub-section 1(b) of Section 434 [2026] 1 S.C.R. 239 The Property Company (P) Ltd. v. Rohinten Daddy Mazda provided that any person who is aggrieved by any decision or order of the CLB made before 01.06.2016 may file an appeal, on any question of law, before the High Court, within 60 days of the date of communication of the decision of the CLB. Therefore, upon being aggrieved by the aforesaid order of the CLB dated 27.05.2016, on 22.07.2016, the appellant company preferred an appeal under Section 10F of the Erstwhile Act before the High Court. 15. It is also apposite to mention that, on 01.06.2016, Section 433 of the Act, 2013, which applied the provisions of the Limitation Act, 1963 (hereinafter, the \"Act, 1963\") to proceedings or appeals before the National Company Law Tribunal (hereinafter, the \"NCLT\") and the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (hereinafter, the \"NCLAT\"), was brought into force. The said provision reads as under: \"433. Limitation. - The provisions of the Limitation Act, 1963 (36 of 1963) shall, as far as may be, apply to proceedings or appeals before the Tribunal or the Appellate Tribunal, as the case may be.\" 16. The High Court in the impugned decision delved into the issue of whether the CLB lacked authority in receiving the appeal under Section 58 of the Act, 2013 beyond the time prescribed therein. Vide its order and judgement dated 16.12.2016, the High Court dismissed the appeal and thereby, upheld the order of the CLB by which the period of delay of 249 days was condoned. While doing so, the High Court discussed as follows: (i) First, it was acknowledged that under the provisions of the Erstwhile Act, the CLB would have the powers which are normally vested in a 'Court' only to the extent that Section 10E(4C) of the Erstwhile Act would allow. Therefore, it was a 'court' only in a restricted sense. Furthermore, it was stated that there cannot be any doubt that the provisions of Section 5 of the Act, 1963 would only be applicable to courts and not to any tribunal/ quasi-judicial body including the CLB, unless such authorities are vested with the powers to condone delay. The decision of this Court in M.P. Steel Corporation v. Commissioner of Central Excise reported in (2015) 7 SCC 58 was discussed in this regard. (ii) Secondly, heavy reliance was placed on the decision of this Court in Canara Bank v. Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd. 240 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports reported in (1995) Supp (3) SCC 81 and a decision rendered by the Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court in Smt. Nupur Mitra v. Basubani Ltd. reported in (1999) SCC OnLine Cal 47. It was stated that Nupur Mitra (supra) had held that in proceedings under Section 111 of the Erstwhile Act, the provisions of the Limitation Act would apply. This view of the Division Bench was also stated to have been affirmed by this Court when the matter was taken in appeal. Therefore, it was opined that the CLB could consider an application for condonation of delay as regards an appeal made under Section 58 of the Act, 2013 (which had replaced Section 111 of the Erstwhile Act) as well. (iii) Thirdly, reference was made to the decision of a Single Judge of the Calcutta High Court in Mackintosh Burn Ltd. v. Sarkar Chowdhury Enterprises P. Ltd. reported in 2015 SCC OnLine Cal 10466 wherein it was observed that although Section 58(4) of the Act, 2013 sets certain time limits, yet the same should not be construed to mean that the CLB would be prevented from receiving an appeal thereunder beyond the stipulated period. The provision also does not explicitly prohibit the receipt of an appeal beyond the expiry of the time-limits indicated therein. Furthermore, it was stated that it has been judicially recognised that the principles contained in the Act, 1963 would be applicable to matters before the CLB. (iv) Lastly, it was observed that a High Court exercising appellate jurisdiction would be required to take into consideration the change in law, if any, that may have occurred during the time the appeal is being decided. For this purpose, the decision of this Court in Lakshmi Narayan Guin v. Niranjan Modak reported in AIR 1985 SC 111 was referred to. The change being alluded to in the present case was the coming into force of Section 433 of the Act, 2013 which expressly made the Act, 1963 applicable to proceedings before the NCLT and NCLAT respectively. It was also stated that an appeal is a continuation of the original proceedings and the order of the CLB, being subject to appeal, could not be said to have reached finality. Therefore, no right could be said to have vested in the appellant company such that they could prevent the application of the Act, 1963 to proceedings before the CLB despite the change in law in that regard. [2026] 1 S.C.R. 241 The Property Company (P) Ltd. v. Rohinten Daddy Mazda 17. The relevant observations made in the impugned decision are as under: \"Under the provisions of Companies Act, 1956, the Company Law Board (CLB) is a Court in a restricted sense. Under Section 10E (4C) of the Companies Act, 1956, the CLB would have powers under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) only in respect of the matters specified in Section 10E (4C) (a) to (f) of the Companies Act. The Company Law Board is a quasi-judicial authority to be guided by the principles of natural justice in exercise of its power and discharge its functions under the Companies Act, 1956 and it shall act in its discretion. There cannot be any doubt that the provisions of Section 5 of the Limitation Act would only be applicable to the Courts and not to any Tribunal, Quasi-Judicial bodies including CLB unless such authorities are vested with the power of enlargement. In M.P. Steel Corporation (supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court after taking into consideration a large number of decisions held that a series of decisions of the Supreme Court have also clearly held that the Limitation Act applies only to Courts and does not apply to quasi-judicial bodies and the decision in Madan Lal Das & Sons reported at ( 1976) 4 SCC, 464, a three-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court is per incuriam as it was decided without adverting to either Parson Tools, (1975) 4 SCC 22 or other earlier judgments. Madan Lal case, therefore, is not an authority for the proposition that the Limitation Act would apply to tribunals as opposed to courts. -xxx- The three decisions of the Company Law Board relied upon by Mr. Saha does not appear to have taken into consideration the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Canara Bank Vs. Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd. & Ors. reported at 1995 (84) Comp Cas 70; 1995(Sup3) SCC 81 and a Division Bench Judgement of the Hon'ble High Court in Smt. Nupur Mitra & Anr. Vs. Basubani Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. reported at 1999 (2) CLT 264 where it has been clearly held that in the absence of a specific provision\n\n242 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports covering application under Section 111, the residuary Article, namely, Article 137 would apply. In Smt. Nupur Mitra (supra), the Hon'ble Division Bench relying upon a decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Canara Bank (supra) held that in proceedings under Section 111 of the Act the provisions of the Limitation Act would apply. The judgment was taken in appeal wherein the Supreme Court after observing, \"various contentions are raised on behalf of both the parties before us and, in particular on behalf of the appellants as regards the limitation and delay. The respondents in their petition have made out a prima facie case for condonation of delay and if necessary, the respondents may file such documents as permissible in law to get the delay condoned'', directed the Company Law Board to hear the matter afresh. Thus, in view of the Supreme Court upholding the decision of the Calcutta High Court that the provisions of the Limitation Act are applicable to the proceedings under Section 111 of the Companies Act, the said decision was binding on the Company Law Board. If so, then the application for condonation of delay can be considered under Section 5 of the Limitation Act. In regard to the application of the Section, the settled law as propounded by the Supreme Court in a number of cases is that the term \"sufficient cause\" in Section 5 must receive liberal construction so as to advance substantial justice and generally delays in bringing the appeal are required to be condoned in the interest of justice where no gross negligence or deliberate inaction or lack of bona fides is imputable to the parties seeking condonation of delay. It may not be out of place to mention that in the case of Smt. Nupur Mitra (supra) the petition under Section 111 of the Act was filed nearly 50 years after the allotment of shares and the Company Law Board dismissed the Petition as time-barred. The order was set aside by the Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court, which decision was confirmed by the Supreme Court and the matter was remanded back to the Company Law Board for consideration afresh. [2026] 1 S.C.R. 243 The Property Company (P) Ltd. v. Rohinten Daddy Mazda In Smt. Nupur Mitra (supra) in Paragraph 65 of the said report, the Hon'ble Division Bench considered the applicability of the Limitation Act and held:- \"65. Assuming that the Limitation Act, 1963 does apply, in the absence of a specific provision covering applications under Section 111, the residuary article namely Article 137 would apply. If the cause of action arose in 1996 as claimed by the appellants, the application under Section 111 having been filed in 1998 would be within time.\" -xxx- A Co-ordinate Bench in M/s Mackintosh Burn (supra) answered the said question in the manner following:- \"Section 58(4) of the Act permits an application though the exact word used is \"appeal\" to be filed by a person within the time stipulated in such provision. The provision is for the benefit of the transferees of shares in a public company and the time-limits are 60 days from the date of the refusal to register the transfer or 90 days of the delivery of the instrument for transfer to the company without any intimation as to its fate. Though the provision sets the time-limits as above, nothing therein prevents the Company Law Board from receiving a petition or application thereunder beyond the stipulated period. Since it is now judicially recognized that the principles contained in the Limitation Act, 1963 would be applicable to matters before the Company Law Board, irrespective of the use of the word \"appeal\" in the relevant provision, it would appear that the Company Law Board would have authority to receive a petition after the expiry of the specified period, by applying the principles of the Limitation Act as may be applicable. The question of law sought to be raised is of no consequence since the provision does not prohibit the receipt of a petition or application thereunder after the expiry of the time-limits indicated therein.\" Moreover, the High Court in exercising an appellate jurisdiction is required to take into consideration the change\n\n244 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports of law. In fact, the decisions cited by Mr. Saha in order to emphasize that the said change of law did not affect the pending proceeding supports the respondent more than the appellant. In Lakshminarayan Guin (supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court had taken note of the change of law to extend protection to a tenant against eviction which was not available to the tenant when the original proceeding was instituted. The intention of the legislature to extend the benefit of such amendment to a tenant in the pending proceeding was manifest. The manifest intention with which Mr. Saha seeks to support the observation of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Lakshminarayan Guin (supra) equally applies in the instant case as failure to apply such principle may cause manifest injustice and miscarriage of justice since by operation of law the petitioner is entitled to have his name recorded in the share register and the refusal to register the share in the name of the petitioner is patently illegal. -xxx- The very fact that an appeal is a continuation of proceedings and the order of CLB is subject to appeal and has not reached finality, therefore, no right appears to have been vested in the appellant in order to attract the mischief of affecting vested right, if there be any. Under such circumstances, this Court finds no reason to interfere with the order passed by the Company Law Board. Since legal issue sought to be raised is devoid on merit ACO No.91 of 2016 and APO No.222 of 2016 are dismissed. However, there shall be no order as to costs.\" (Emphasis supplied) D. SUBMISSIONS OF THE PARTIES I. Submissions on behalf of the appellant company 18. Ms. Nina Nariman, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant company submitted, at the outset, that the impugned [2026] 1 S.C.R. 245 The Property Company (P) Ltd. v. Rohinten Daddy Mazda decision fails to take into account the settled position of law that the Act, 1963 is not applicable to tribunals or quasi-judicial bodies. Therefore, the CLB acted without authority while condoning the delay of 249 days in filing the appeal under Section 58 of the Act, 2013. 19. It was submitted that Regulation 44 of the CLB Regulations saving the inherent powers of the CLB could not be said to empower it to circumvent the mandatory time-limit to file a petition provided in the statute and that the said regulation has no manner of application in the matter of condonation of delay in the instant case. The power of condonation has to be conferred specifically by the statute itself or by way of the statute adopting the provisions of the Act, 1963 akin to what has been provided for under Section 433 of the Act, 2013. 20. It was submitted that on the date on which the decision of the CLB was rendered, the provisions of Section 433 of the Act, 2013 had not come into force. They had come into force only w.e.f. 01.06.2016 i.e., four days after the CLB had passed its order. While it is conceded that the effect of the coming into force of Section 433 is that the NCLT would have the powers to condone delay in respect of \"proceedings\" or \"appeals\" before itself if sufficient cause is made out, the same cannot be imputed to the status of things which existed prior to 01.06.2016. 21. The counsel would also submit that an appeal under Section 58(3) of the Act, 2013 would be in the nature of an original proceeding and Section 5 of the Act, 1963 could not be said to confer any power upon a court or tribunal to condone delay in respect of a proceeding of original nature. It is only an \"appeal\" or an \"application\" in respect of which delay can be condoned. 22. She would submit that Section 58(3) of the Act, 2013 is analogous to Section 111(3) of the Erstwhile Act. The decision of this Court in Canara Bank (supra) had observed that the appeal by a shareholder instituted before the CLB under Sections 111(2) and 111(3) of the Erstwhile Act respectively, would be an 'original application' despite its nomenclature as an 'appeal'. The counsel placed further reliance on the decisions of this Court in Mardia Chemicals Ltd. v. Union of India reported in (2004) 4 SCC 311 and Gopal Sardar v. Karuna Sardar reported in (2004) 4 SCC 252 to buttress her argument that proceedings would be of an original nature despite the use of the word \"appeal\" under the said provision. 246 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports 23. The counsel would also submit that the impugned decision had misread the observations made by this Court in the order dated 14.09.1999 in Civil Appeal Nos. 5063-64 of 1999, by which this Court disposed of the appeal against the decision of the Calcutta High Court in Smt. Nupur Mitra (supra). 24. In such circumstances referred to above, the learned counsel prayed that there being merit in her appeal, the same may be allowed and the impugned decision of the High Court be set-aside. II. Submissions on behalf of the respondent 25. On the other hand, Ms. Meenakshi Arora, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the respondent would submit that the impugned decision correctly arrived at the conclusion that there was no negligence on the part of the respondent in filing the appeal before the CLB under Section 58 of the Act, 2013 and also that the application seeking condonation of delay was rightly allowed. 26. The counsel would submit that Section 58(3) of the Act, 2013 prescribes a period of 30 days from the date of the notice of refusal from the company or in case no such notice was obtained, then a period of 60 days from the date the instrument of transfer or intimation of transmission was delivered to the company, within which an appeal must be preferred to the CLB (now, NCLT) by the transferee. 27. The counsel drew a comparison with Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 to indicate that unlike the said provision, which uses the words \"but not thereafter\", there was no indication under Section 58(3) that an appeal cannot be filed beyond the period of 30 or 60 days, as the case may be. 28. The counsel submitted that Section 29(2) of the Act, 1963 clearly provides that where any special or local law prescribes for any suit, appeal or application, a period of limitation different from that prescribed by the Schedule to the Act, 1963, then Section 3 of the Act, 1963 would apply as if such period indicated under the special or local law were the period prescribed by the Schedule. Therefore, for determining any period of limitation prescribed for a suit, appeal or application by any special or local law, the provisions contained in Sections 4 to 24 of the Act, 1963 respectively (both inclusive) would apply, only insofar as, and to the extent of which, they are not expressly excluded by such special or local law. In her view, even [2026] 1 S.C.R. 247 The Property Company (P) Ltd. v. Rohinten Daddy Mazda before the coming into force of Section 433 of the Act, 2013, there was no express exclusion of the provisions of the Act, 1963 and therefore, the CLB could be said to have the power under Section 5 of the Act, 1963 to condone the delay in preferring the appeal under Section 58(3) of the Act, 2013. 29. The counsel placed heavy reliance on the decision of this Court in M.P. Steel (supra) wherein it was held that the principles of the Act, 1963 as contained Section 14 would apply to applications or appeals made before a quasi-judicial body/tribunal. 30. Even otherwise, it was submitted that since an appeal before the High Court under Section 10F of the Erstwhile Act would be a continuation of the original proceedings, the order of the CLB had not attained finality and the High Court was right in considering the change in law that was brought forth by the coming into force of Section 433 of the Act, 2013. Therefore, no right could be said to have been otherwise vested in the appellant company. In this regard, the counsel would refer to the decision of this Court in Lakshmi Narayan Guin (supra), Dilip v. Mohd. Azizul Haque & Anr. reported in (2000) 3 SCC 607 and H.V. Rajan v. C.N. Gopal & Ors. reported in (1975) 4 SCC 302. 31. In such circumstances as referred to above, the counsel prayed that there being no merit in this appeal, the same may be dismissed. E. ISSUES FOR DETERMINATION 32. Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and having gone through the materials on record, the following questions fall for our consideration: I. Whether the CLB, being a quasi-judicial body, could be said to have the power to condone the delay in filing an appeal under Section 58(3) of the Act, 2013? In other words, even if Section 5 of the Act, 1963, per say, could not be applied to quasi-judicial bodies, whether the principles underlying Section 5 of the Act, 1963 be made applicable to an appeal under Section 58(3) of the Act, 2013, instituted before the CLB? II. Whether Section 433 of the Act, 2013 which was brought into force on 01.06.2016 in order to empower the NCLT and NCLAT respectively, to apply the provisions of the Act, 1963, could be given retrospective effect such that it applied to the CLB as well? 248 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports F. ANALYSIS I. The implementation of the provisions of the Act, 2013 in phases and the powers conferred upon the CLB in the period between 12.09.2013 and 01.06.2016. 33. In order to ensure a smooth transition into the new framework, the Act, 2013 was implemented in phases. Section 1 of the Act, 2013 came into force on 30.08.2013. Section 1, itself, indicated that different dates may be appointed for the coming into force of different provisions. 34. A group of 98 sections or parts thereof was brought into force on 12.09.2013. It is noteworthy to mention that Section 58 of the Act, 2013 formed a part of this group. 35. Much thereafter, on 01.06.2016, Chapter XXVII which contained several provisions relating to the constitution of the NCLT and NCLAT respectively and their powers, was brought into force. This included Section 433 as well. 36. In the period between 12.09.2013 and 01.06.2016, a mix of provisions i.e., certain provisions from the Erstwhile Act and certain provisions from the Act, 2013 held the field. In other words, when the new provisions were being brought into force in phases, the provisions of the Erstwhile Act were also being repealed in phases. 37. The facts and circumstances of the present matter are peculiar for the reason that the appeal under Section 58(3) of the Act, 2013 was filed during this period between 12.09.2013 and 01.06.2016. In other words, the Section 58(3) appeal was filed at a time when the NCLT and NCLAT had not yet been constituted. Therefore, although the appeal was made under the new provision of the Act, 2013, yet the body/forum before which it was made was one constituted under the provisions of the Erstwhile Act, i.e., the CLB. 38. Insofar as the CLB is concerned, Section 10E of the Erstwhile Act dealt with how it was to be constituted and the kind of powers that it could exercise. More particularly, Section 10E(4C) of the Erstwhile Act specifically stated that the CLB shall have the same powers which are otherwise vested in a Court trying a suit under the CPC, only in respect of certain specific matters which included the discovery and inspection of documents, examining witnesses on oath etc. In\n\n[2026] 1 S.C.R. 249 The Property Company (P) Ltd. v. Rohinten Daddy Mazda respect of matters pertaining to limitation, there was no express provision which permitted the CLB to act in a manner similar to that of a court. The relevant provision is reproduced as under: \"(4C) Every Bench referred to in sub-section (4B) shall have powers which are vested in a Court under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), while trying a suit, in respect of the following matters, namely : - (a) discovery and inspection of documents or other material objects producible as evidence ; (b) enforcing the attendance of witnesses and requiring the deposit of their expenses ; (c) compelling the production of documents or other material objects producible as evidence and impounding the same ; (d) examining witnesses on oath ; (e) granting adjournments ; (f) reception of evidence on affidavits.\" 39. It was only when an appeal was instituted before the High Court, by a person aggrieved by any decision or order of the CLB, that Section 10F of the Erstwhile Act, allowed the condonation of delay upon sufficient cause being shown. However, even this was capped for a further period not exceeding sixty days. In other words, the maximum period within which one could prefer an appeal before the High Court against an order of the CLB was 120 days (60 days + 60 days). Section 10F is reproduced as under: \"10F. APPEALS AGAINST THE ORDERS OF THE COMPANY LAW BOARD Any person aggrieved by any decision or order of the Company Law Board may file an appeal to the High Court within sixty days from the date of communication of the decision or order of the Company Law Board to him on any question of law arising out of such order : Provided that the High Court may, if it is satisfied that the appellant was prevented by sufficient cause from filing the 250 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports appeal within the said period, allow it to be filed within a further period not exceeding sixty days.\" (Emphasis supplied) 40. What is evident from the aforesaid is that, during the period between 12.09.2013 and 01.06.2016, it was the CLB which was the adjudicating authority even as regards a proceeding initiated under the new provisions of the Act, 2013. We deem it necessary to reemphasize that there was no provision either akin to or corresponding to Section 433 of the Act, 2013 which empowered the CLB to apply the Act, 1963 during this period between 12.09.2013 and 01.06.2016. The legislature had very consciously timed the coming into force of Section 433 of the Act, 2013 with that of the creation of the NCLT and NCLAT respectively, which unambiguously revealed their intention to not confer the CLB with any power insofar as the issue of limitation was concerned. 41. Therefore, it now becomes necessary for us to examine whether the Act, 1963 would apply to those quasi-judicial bodies which are not specifically or expressly empowered to apply the provisions of the Act, 1963. Even if this is answered in the negative, would it be permissible for us to accept the submission made by Ms. Arora that the principles underlying certain provisions of the Act, 1963 should nevertheless be made applicable to such quasi-judicial bodies? II. Whether the CLB, being a quasi-judicial body, could be said to have the power to condone the delay in filing an appeal under Section 58(3) of the Act, 2013? a. The Act, 1963, per say, does not apply to quasi-judicial bodies - emphasis on the court as an institution. 42. In the absence of a specific provision in the special legislation which expressly extends the application of the Act, 1963 to proceedings before the concerned quasi-judicial body or the system of quasi- judicial bodies, the thumb rule is that the rules of limitation, not only those that seek to lay down a prescribed period but also those envisaged under Sections 4 to 24 respectively of the Act, 1963, would remain inapplicable to quasi-judicial bodies. 43. The crux of the underlying reasoning behind such a position is the reluctance and disinclination to apply those rules and principles [2026] 1 S.C.R. 251 The Property Company (P) Ltd. v. Rohinten Daddy Mazda pertaining to limitation, to bodies to which it was not contemplated to have any application. This can be a double-edged sword at times, i.e., although the proceedings before these quasi-judicial bodies would be governed by their own prescribed period of limitation without any conflict with the timelines laid out in the Schedule to the Act, 1963 yet this would also mean that the other provisions included within Sections 4 to 24 respectively of the Act, 1963, which more often than not, come to the aid of the litigant, would remain inaccessible to persons pursuing remedies before quasi-judicial bodies. 44. This general and universal rule that the Act, 1963 only applies to 'civil courts' was expounded in the decision of this Court in Town Municipal Council, Athani v. Presiding Officer, Labour Courts, Hubli and Others reported in (1969) 1 SCC 873 which was concerned with applications made by workmen, before the Labour Court, under Section 33-C(2) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. The aforesaid legislation did not expressly make the provisions of the Act, 1963 applicable to Labour Courts. However, one of the pleas raised was that the applications under Section 33-C(2) were time-barred in view of Article 137 of the Schedule to the Act, 1963. The aforesaid plea came to be rejected and a two-fold reasoning was assigned - (a) that the provisions of the Act, 1963, more specifically, Article 137, would only govern applications made under the CPC; and (b) At the very least, it was stated that Article 137 is only concerned with those applications which are presented to a \"court\" as understood in the strictest sense and not to quasi-judicial bodies. On the latter aspect, with which we are directly concerned, it was elaborated as follows: (i) First, that on a closer look at the Articles under the Third Division of the Schedule to the Act, 1963, which deals with 'applications', it is plainly evident that all these applications should be presented before a 'court'. Even the applications as regards the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, which find mention in the Third Division, were to be presented before 'courts'. Therefore, the determining factor would be whether the application is made before a court or not. In other words, it is the forum before which the application is made which ought to be given importance to. If it is a court then, there would be no restriction in applying the Articles contained in the third division for the purpose of limitation. However, if the application is made before a tribunal or a quasi-judicial body, 252 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports then the said Articles cannot be applied. To put it simply, \"the scope of the various articles in this division cannot be held to have been so enlarged as to include within them applications to bodies other than courts, such as a quasi-judicial tribunal, or even an executive authority\". (ii) Secondly, the change in the long title of the Act, 1963 in comparison to the old Limitation Act, 1908 was taken note of. It was changed from \"an Act to consolidate and amend the law for the limitation of suits and for other purposes\" to \"An Act to consolidate and amend the law for the limitation of suits and other proceedings and for purposes connected therewith\". It was opined that the addition of the word \"other proceedings\" in the long title, could not be said to necessarily imply that the Act, 1963 was now enlarged in scope to also govern proceedings before any authority, whether executive or quasi-judicial, in comparison to the old Limitation Act which was intended to govern proceedings before civil courts only. The purposes for which the Act, 1963 was enacted, in the opinion of this Court, could not be construed as having been fundamentally altered due to the change in the phrasing of the long title to the Act, 1963. The relevant observations are thus: \"12.This point, in our opinion, may be looked at from another angle also. When this Court earlier held that all the articles in the third division to the schedule, including Article 181 of the Limitation Act of 1908, governed applications under the Code of Civil Procedure only, it clearly implied that the applications must be presented to a court governed by the Code of Civil Procedure. Even the applications under the Arbitration Act that were included within the third division by amendment of Articles 158 and 178 were to be presented to courts whose proceedings were governed by the Code of Civil Procedure. At best, the further amendment now made enlarges the scope of the third division of the schedule so as also to include some applications presented to courts governed by the Code of Criminal Procedure. One factor at least remains constant and that is that the applications must be to courts to be governed by the articles in this division. The scope of the various articles in this division\n\n[2026] 1 S.C.R. 253 The Property Company (P) Ltd. v. Rohinten Daddy Mazda cannot be held to have been so enlarged as to include within them applications to bodies other than courts, such as a quasi-judicial tribunal, or even an executive authority. An Industrial Tribunal or a Labour Court dealing with applications or references under the Act are not courts and they are in no way governed either by the Code of Civil Procedure or the Code of Criminal Procedure. We cannot, therefore, accept the submission made that this article will apply even to applications made to an Industrial Tribunal or a Labour Court. The alterations made in the article and in the new Act cannot, in our opinion, justify the interpretation that even applications presented to bodies, other than courts, are now to be governed for purposes of limitation by Article 137. 13.Reliance in this connection was placed by learned counsel for the appellant primarily on the decision of the Bombay High Court inP.K. Parwalv.Labour Court, Nagpur. [1966 SCC OnLine Bom 99 : (1968) 70 Bom LR 104] We are unable to agree with the view taken by the Bombay High Court in that case. The High Court ignored the circumstance that the provisions of Article 137 were sought to be applied to an application which was presented not to a court but to a Labour Court dealing with an application under Section 33-C(2) of the Act and that such a Labour Court is not governed by any procedural code relating to Civil or Criminal Proceedings. That court appears to have been considerably impressed by the fact that, in the new Limitation Act of 1963, an alteration was made in the long title which has been incorrectly described by that court as preamble. Under the old Limitation Act, no doubt, the long title was \"an Act to consolidate and amend the law for the limitation of suits and for other purposes\", while, in the new Act of 1963, the long title is \"An Act to consolidate and amend the law for the limitation of suits and other proceedings and for purposes connected therewith\". In the long title, thus, the words \"other proceedings\" have been added; but we do not think that this addition necessarily implies that the Limitation Act is intended to govern proceedings before any authority, whether executive or 254 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports quasi-judicial, when, earlier, the old Act was intended to govern proceedings before civil courts only. It is also true that the preamble which existed in the old Limitation Act of 1908, has been omitted in the new Act of 1963. The omission of the preamble does not, however, indicate that there was any intention of the legislature to change the purposes for which the Limitation Act has been enforced. The Bombay High Court also attached importance to the circumstance that the scope of the new Limitation Act has been enlarged by changing the definition of \"applicant\" in Section 2(a) of the new Act so as to include even a petitioner and the word \"application\" so as to include a petition. The question still remains whether this alteration can be held to be intended to cover petitions by a petitioner to authorities other than Courts. We are unable to find any provision in the new Limitation Act which would justify holding that these changes in definition were intended to make the Limitation Act applicable to proceedings before bodies other than Courts. We have already taken notice of the change introduced in the third division of the Schedule by including references to applications under the Code of Criminal Procedure, which was the only other aspect relied upon by the Bombay High Court in support of its view that applications under Section 33-C of the Act will also be governed by the new Article 137. For the reasons we have indicated earlier, we are unable to accept the view expressed by the Bombay High Court; and we hold that Article 137 of the Schedule to the Limitation Act, 1963, does not apply to applications under Section 33-C(2) of the Act, so that the previous decision of this Court that no limitation is prescribed for such applications remains unaffected.\" (Emphasis supplied) 45. The first leg of the two-fold reasoning adopted in Town Municipal Council, Athani (supra) came to be seriously doubted and the fate of applications made under other laws but before \"courts\" seemed to be in a limbo. More particularly, the question was whether applications made to courts under the provisions of other laws, apart from the CPC, would be included within the scope of the Act, 1963 or not.\n\n[2026] 1 S.C.R. 255 The Property Company (P) Ltd. v. Rohinten Daddy Mazda 46. The aforesaid confusion was resolved by the three-judge bench decision of this Court in Kerala State Electricity Board, Trivandrum v. T.P. Kunhaliumma reported in (1976) 4 SCC 634. Therein, the issue was whether Article 137 of the Act, 1963 would apply to a petition under Section 16(3) of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 claiming compensation against the Electricity Board, made before the District Judge. While reaching the conclusion that Article 137 of the Act, 1963 would apply to any petition or application filed under 'any Act' to a civil court and disagreeing with Town Municipal Council, Athani (supra) on this aspect, the Bench elucidated as follows: (i) First, that Article 137 of the Act, 1963 would include a petition or any application made under 'any Act' and cannot be strictly confined to applications made under the CPC. However, one must be cognisant in recognising that such an application under any other Act should be made before a 'court' as understood in the traditional sense. The reason being that Sections 4 and 5 of the Act, 1963 respectively speak of the expiry of the prescribed period when the 'court' is closed and also extension of the prescribed period if the 'court' is satisfied about the existence of sufficient cause in not preferring the appeal or application during the stipulated time period. (ii) Secondly, this Court delved into the aspect of the specific import of the words \"District Judge\" used in Section 16(3) of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885. In other words, the attempt was to ascertain whether the aforesaid words would refer to a determination by the District Judge 'acting judicially as a court' or not. It was held that Section 16 contained intrinsic evidence to indicate that reference was being made to the 'court of the District Judge'. Therefore, it was concluded, that there existed no reason to withhold the application of Article 137. The relevant observations are reproduced hereinbelow: \"18.The alteration of the division as well as the change in the collocation of words in Article 137 of the Limitation Act, 1963 compared with Article 181 of the 1908 Limitation Act shows that applications contemplated under Article 137 are not applications confined to the Code of Civil Procedure. In the 1908 Limitation Act there was no division between 256 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports applications in specified cases and other applications as in the 1963 Limitation Act. The words \"any other application\" under Article 137 cannot be said on the principle of ejusdem generis to be applications under the Civil Procedure Code other than those mentioned in Part I of the third division. Any other application under Article 137 would be petition or any application under any Act. But it has to be an application to a court for the reason that Sections 4 and 5 of the 1963 Limitation Act speak of expiry of prescribed period when court is closed and extension of prescribed period if applicant or the appellant satisfies the court that he had sufficient cause for not preferring the appeal or making the application during such period. -xxx- 20.The provisions in the Telegraph Act which contemplate determination by the District Judge of payment of compensation payable under Section 10 of the Act indicate that the District Judge acts judicially as a court. Where by statutes matters are referred for determination by a court of record with no further provision the necessary implication is that the court will determine the matters as a court. (SeeNational Telephone Co. Ltd.v.Postmaster-General[1913 AC 546 : 82 LJKB 1197 : 29 TLR 637] . In the present case the statute makes the reference to the District Judge as the Presiding Judge of the District Court. In many statutes reference is made to the District Judge under this particular title while the intention is to refer to the court of the District Judge. The Telegraph Act in Section 16 contains intrinsic evidence that the District Judge is mentioned there as the court of the District Judge. Section 16(4) of the Telegraph Act requires payment into the court of the District Judge such amount as the telegraph authority deems sufficient if any dispute arises as to the persons entitled to receive compensation. Again, in Section 34 of the Telegraph Act reference is made to payment of court fees and issue of processes both of which suggest that the ordinary machinery of a court of civil jurisdiction is being made available for the settlement of these disputes. Section 3(17) of the General Clauses Act states that the District Judge in any Act of\n\n[2026] 1 S.C.R. 257 The Property Company (P) Ltd. v. Rohinten Daddy Mazda the Central Legislature means the judge of a principal civil court of original jurisdiction other than the High Court in the exercise of its original civil jurisdiction, unless there is anything repugnant in the context. In the Telegraph Act there is nothing in the context to suggest that the reference to the District Judge is not intended as a reference to the District Court which seems to be the meaning implied by the definition applicable thereto. The District Judge under the Telegraph Act acts as a civil court in dealing with applications under Section 16 of the Telegraph Act. 21.The changed definition of the words \"applicant\" and \"application\" contained in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) of the 1963 Limitation Act indicates the object of the Limitation Act to include petitions, original or otherwise, under special laws. The interpretation which was given to Article 181 of the 1908 Limitation Act on the principle of ejusdem generis is not applicable with regard to Article 137 of the 1963 Limitation Act. Article 137 stands in isolation from all other articles in Part I of the third division. This Court inNityananda Joshi casehas rightly thrown doubt on the two-Judge Bench decision of this Court inAthani Municipal Council casewhere this Court construed Article 137 to be referable to applications under the Civil Procedure Code. Article 137 includes petitions within the word \"applications\". These petitions and applications can be under any special Act as in the present case. 22.The conclusion we reach is that Article 137 of the 1963 Limitation Act will apply to any petition or application filed under any Act to a civil court. With respect we differ from the view taken by the two-judge bench of this Court inAthani Municipal Council case[(1969) 1 SCC 873 : (1970) 1 SCR 51] and hold that Article 137 of the 1963 Limitation Act is not confined to applications contemplated by or under the Code of Civil Procedure. The petition in the present case was to the District Judge as a court. The petition was one contemplated by the Telegraph Act for judicial decision. The petition is an application falling within the scope of Article 137 of the 1963 Limitation Act.\" (Emphasis supplied) 258 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports 47. Although the aforesaid two decisions of this Court were directly concerned with the application of Article 137 of the Schedule to the Act, 1963 to applications made before quasi-judicial bodies, yet they laid down a larger general rule regarding the scope and extent of application of the Act, 1963, as a whole, to tribunals or quasi-judicial bodies created by special laws; more particularly those laws, wherein no express provision seeking to apply the Act, 1963 to proceedings before the concerned quasi-judicial body/tribunal existed. 48. On a careful scrutiny, it can be culled out that the aspect which pre-occupied this Court in the aforementioned two decisions is the absolute necessity of the 'court' or the system of courts as envisaged in the Constitution which ought to be held as solely capable of applying the provisions of the Act, 1963. Therefore, notable and significant emphasis was placed on which institution/body is seeking to employ certain provisions of limitation or exercise the powers entrusted under the Act, 1963. The general rule, in this context, is a strict and unmalleable one i.e., it is only the courts which would concern itself with the provisions of the Act, 1963 unless expressly indicated otherwise in any special law governing quasi-judicial bodies. 49. This general rule was only bolstered through several landmark decisions which came subsequently. A three-judge bench of this Court in Commissioner of Sales Tax, U.P., Lucknow v. Parson Tools and Plants, Kanpur reported in (1975) 4 SCC 22 observed thus: \"9.[…] In view of these pronouncements of this Court, there is no room for argument that the Appellate Authority and the Judge (Revisions) Sales tax exercising jurisdiction under the Sales Tax Act, are \"courts\". They are merely Administrative Tribunals and \"not courts\". Section 14, Limitation Act, therefore, does not, in terms apply to proceedings before such tribunals.\" (Emphasis supplied) 50. Several decisions that came subsequent to Parson Tools (supra) have also reinforced that the Act, 1963 could be applied to appeals or applications made to 'courts' only. Without engaging in the exercise of specifically referring to each of these decisions, we refer with profit to the decision of this Court in M.P. Steel (supra), wherein this issue was put to rest and it was stated as follows: [2026] 1 S.C.R. 259 The Property Company (P) Ltd. v. Rohinten Daddy Mazda \"19. […] On a plain reading of the provisions of the Limitation Act, it becomes clear that suits, appeals and applications are only to be considered (from the limitation point of view) if they are filed in courts and not in quasi- judicial bodies. -xxx- 21. […] The question in this case is whether the Limitation Act extends beyond the court system mentioned above and embraces within its scope quasi-judicial bodies as well? 22.A series of decisions of this Court have clearly held that the Limitation Act applies only to courts and does not apply to quasi-judicial bodies. […]\" (Emphasis supplied) 51. On a reading of the aforementioned decisions, it can be stated, without doubt, that the provisions of the Act, 1963 (provisions that lay down a prescribed period of limitation as well as Sections 4 to 24 of the Act, 1963 respectively) would only apply to suits, applications or appeals which are made under any law to 'courts' and not to those made before quasi-judicial bodies or tribunals, unless such quasi- judicial bodies or tribunals are specifically empowered in that regard. 52. This discussion which reveals that the application of the provisions of the Act, 1963 is \"body/forum specific\" would also be relevant in addressing a particular submission made by Ms. Arora - that Section 433 of the Act, 2013 which specifically empowers the NCLT and the NCLAT respectively to apply the provisions of the Act, 1963 to proceedings or appeals before itself, must be given retrospective effect such that it applies to the CLB as well. However, we shall deal with this submission, in the latter parts of our discussion. b. Decisions of this Court as regards the application of Section 5 of the Act, 1963 to quasi-judicial bodies or tribunals 53. Insofar as the application of Section 5 of the Act, 1963 to quasi- judicial bodies is concerned, this Court has always indicated that the same can only be applied to 'courts'. In Officer on Special Duty (Land Acquisition) and Another v. Shah Manilal Chandulal and Others reported in (1996) 9 SCC 414, this Court had categorically\n\n260 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports held that Section 5 of the Act, 1963 cannot be resorted to by statutory authorities which are not 'courts'. Therein, this Court was concerned with whether the Collector or the Land Acquisition Officer could extend time. 54. It is interesting to note that in Officer on Special Duty (supra), a State amendment to the concerned provision clarified that the orders made by the Collector under that provision shall be subject to revision by the High Court and for that specific purpose, the Collector was to be considered to be a court subordinate to the High Court. In the impugned decision therein, this amendment was wrongly construed as conferring the Collector with the powers of a court even as regards Section 5 of the Act, 1963. This Court clarified that the aforesaid local amendment treated the Collector as a court only for a 'limited purpose' i.e., for the exercise of revisional jurisdiction and that this could not be conflated with the powers under Section 5 of the Act, 1963. The relevant observations are thus: \"4.The question, therefore, is: whether Section 5 of the Limitation Act would apply? The High Court relied upon sub-section (3) of Section 18 which was made by way of a local amendment, i.e., the Land Acquisition (Maharashtra Extension and Amendment) Act 38 of 1964 which reads thus: \"Any order made by the Collector on an application under this section shall be subject to revision by the High Court, as if the Collector were a Court subordinate to the High Court within the meaning of Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.\" 5.It would appear that the High Court of Gujarat has taken a consistent view that, by operation of sub-section (3), as the Collector was designated to be a court subordinate to the High Court under Section 115, Civil Procedure Code (for short \"CPC\"), Section 5 of the Limitation Act (26 of 1963) stands attracted. Though sub-section (3) of Section 18, by virtue of local amendments, treated the Collector as court for a limited purpose of exercising revisional jurisdiction under Section 115, CPC to correct errors of orders passed by the Collector under Section 18, he cannot [2026] 1 S.C.R. 261 The Property Company (P) Ltd. v. Rohinten Daddy Mazda be considered to be a court for the purpose of Section 5 of the Limitation Act. Section 5 of the Limitation Act stands attracted only when LAO acts as a court.\" (Emphasis supplied) 55. Another decision of this Court in Prakash H. Jain v. Marie Fernandes (supra) reported in (2003) 8 SCC 431 which was also concerned with the condonation of delay by a statutory authority, observed as follows: i. First, that while considering the issue of condonation of delay, one must look not only at the nature and character of the authority i.e., whether it is a court or not, but also pay careful attention to the nature of the powers already conferred upon such authorities, the scheme underlying the provisions of the concerned Act, the extent or the boundaries of the powers contained therein and especially take into account the intention of the legislature. ii. Secondly, there is no such thing as any inherent power to condone delay in filing any proceedings, unless specifically warranted and permitted by law, since reading such an inherent power would have the consequence of altering the rights accrued to a party under the concerned statute. iii. Thirdly, when a statutory authority is 'deemed' to be a court for certain limited and specific purposes, it must not be taken to mean that it would be a court for any and all other purposes as well. The legal fiction must be given full effect, however, it must not be extended beyond the purpose for which the fiction was created. Therefore, unless expressly indicated, such statutory authorities cannot be clothed with any power that is to be exercised under the Act, 1963. The relevant observations are reproduced hereinbelow: \"10.We have carefully considered the submissions of the learned counsel appearing on either side. Questions of the nature raised before us have to be considered not only on the nature and character of the authority, whether it is court or not but also on the nature of powers conferred on such authority or court, the scheme underlying the provisions of the Act concerned and the nature of powers,\n\n262 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports the extent thereof or the limitations, if any, contained therein with particular reference to the intention of the legislature as well, found expressed therein. There is no such thing as any inherent power of court to condone delay in filing proceedings before a court/authority concerned, unless the law warrants and permits it, since it has a tendency to alter the rights accrued to one or the other party under the statute concerned. […]\" -xxx- 12. […] but the various provisions under Chapter VIII unmistakably indicate that the competent authority constituted thereunder is not \"court\" and the mere fact that such authority is deemed to be court only for limited and specific purposes, cannot make it a court for all or any other purpose and at any rate for the purpose of either making the provisions of the Limitation Act, 1963 attracted to proceedings before such competent authority or clothe such authority with any power to be exercised under the Limitation Act. It is by now well settled by innumerable judgments of various courts including this Court, that when a statute enacts that anything shall be deemed to be some other thing the only meaning possible is that whereas the said thing is not in reality that something, the legislative enactment requires it to be treated as if it is so. Similarly, though full effect must be given to the legal fiction, it should not be extended beyond the purpose for which the fiction has been created and all the more, when the deeming clause itself confines, as in the present case, the creation of fiction for only a limited purpose as indicated therein. Consequently, under the very scheme of provisions enacted in Chapter VIII of the Act and the avowed legislative purpose obviously made known patently by those very provisions, the competent authority can by no means be said to be \"court\" for any and every purpose and that too for availing of or exercising powers under the Limitation Act, 1963. 13.The competent authority constituted under and for the purposes of the provisions contained in Chapter VIII of [2026] 1 S.C.R. 263 The Property Company (P) Ltd. v. Rohinten Daddy Mazda the Act is merely and at best a statutory authority created for a definite purpose and to exercise, no doubt, powers in a quasi-judicial manner but its powers are strictly circumscribed by the very statutory provisions which conferred upon it those powers and the same could be exercised in the manner provided therefor and subject to such conditions and limitations stipulated by the very provision of law under which the competent authority itself has been created.\" (Emphasis supplied) 56. Viewing the facts and circumstances of the present case in light of the ratio of Officer on Special Duty (supra) and Prakash H. Jain (supra), it can be seen that the CLB was also to be treated as a court but for very limited purposes which were enumerated under Section 10E(4C) of the Erstwhile Act. Therefore, the powers conferred under Section 10E(4C) must neither be conflated with nor extended to encompass the powers which a court would otherwise exercise under Section 5 of the Act, 1963. 57. In yet another decision of this Court in Om Prakash v. Ashwani Kumar Bassi reported in (2010) 9 SCC 183, it was stated that the Rent Controller, being a creature of statute, would only be able to act in terms of the powers vested in him by the statute and would therefore, be incapable of entertaining an application under Section 5 of the Act, 1963 for the condonation of delay or extension of time. It was observed thus: \"24. […] There is no specific provision to vest the Rent Controller with authority to extend the time for making of such affidavit and the application. The Rent Controller being a creature of statute can only act in terms of the powers vested in him by statute and cannot, therefore, entertain an application under Section 5 of the Limitation Act for condonation of delay since the statute does not vest him with such power.\" (Emphasis supplied) 58. The aforesaid decisions are direct authorities for the proposition that Section 5 of the Act, 1963 is not to be utilised by statutory bodies 264 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports or authorities for the purpose of extending time or condoning delay. However, since heavy reliance has been placed on the decision of this Court in M.P. Steel (supra) to submit that the principles underlying Section 5 of the Act, 1963 must nevertheless be made applicable to statutory authorities or quasi-judicial bodies, we must see if the decisions of this Court in Officer on Special Duty (supra), Prakash H. Jain (supra) and Om Prakash (supra) still hold good. c. Whether the principles underlying certain provisions of the Act, 1963 could be made applicable to quasi-judicial bodies or tribunals. 59. We are aware that although the provisions of the Act, 1963 per say have been made inapplicable to applications or appeals before quasi-judicial bodies, yet the principles underlying the provisions of the Act, 1963, more specifically Section 14 thereof, have been made applicable to applications or appeals made before quasi-judicial bodies. This aspect of applying the principles underlying Section 14 of the Act, 1963 was discussed in Parson Tools (supra). 60. Although the decision in Parson Tools (supra) did not apply the principles underlying Section 14 of the Act, 1963 to the facts of their case, based on how the concerned provision i.e., Section 10 of the U.P. Sales Tax Act, 1948, was phrased, yet it left open the possibility for future decisions to apply the said principles where a contrary intention could not be inferred or culled out from the provision to which the principles underlying Section 14 was sought to be applied. 61. Subsequently, this Court in M.P. Steel (supra) took forward the idea that the principles underlying Section 14 of the Act, 1963 could be applied to a provision, unless a contrary intention appears from its wording. This was because the principles upon which Section 14 is based are those which advance the cause of justice. In the facts of that case, this Court permitted the application of the principles underlying Section 14 of the Act, 1963 to an appeal filed by the appellant under Section 128 of the Customs Act, 1962 and remanded the matter to the Commissioner (Appeals) for a decision on merits. 62. In the course of arriving at the said conclusion, M.P. Steel (supra) referred to a vital distinction between exclusion of time and condonation of delay, the former relating to Section 14 of the Act, 1963 and the latter relating to Section 5 of the Act, 1963. This [2026] 1 S.C.R. 265 The Property Company (P) Ltd. v. Rohinten Daddy Mazda difference was discussed because the provision with which they were concerned i.e., Section 128 of the Customs Act, 1962, stated that time could not be 'extended' beyond a further period of three months. In examining whether the aforesaid stipulation would impede or qualify the application of the principles underlying Section 14 of the Act, 1963, it was stated that 'exclusion of time' is conceptually different from 'extension of time/condonation of delay' and it is only the latter for which the statute has prescribed an outer-limit of an additional period of three months. Therefore, as far as the exclusion of time under Section 14 was concerned, it could not be said that there was any upper-limit as such that was prescribed in the provision. The relevant observations made in M.P. Steel (supra) are reproduced as follows: \"43.[…] Also, the principle of Section 14 would apply not merely in condoning delay within the outer period prescribed for condonation but would apply dehors such period for the reason pointed out inConsolidated Engg. [(2008) 7 SCC 169] above, being the difference between exclusion of a certain period altogether under Section 14 principles and condoning delay. As has been pointed out in the said judgment, when a certain period is excluded by applying the principles contained in Section 14, there is no delay to be attributed to the appellant and the limitation period provided by the statute concerned continues to be the stated period and not more than the stated period. We conclude, therefore, that the principle of Section 14 which is a principle based on advancing the cause of justice would certainly apply to exclude time taken in prosecuting proceedings which are bona fide and with due diligence pursued, which ultimately end without a decision on the merits of the case.\" (Emphasis supplied) 63. In contemplating whether the aforesaid decisions in Parson Tools (supra) and M.P. Steel (supra) which relate to applying the principles underlying Section 14 of the Act, 1963 to provisions which pertain to quasi-judicial bodies, could also be resorted to in the present case, we must take forward the distinction between Section 5 and Section 14 of the Act, 1963 respectively which was alluded to in M.P. 266 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports Steel (supra). This is because we are concerned with whether the principles underlying Section 5 of the Act, 1963, could be applied to provisions relating to quasi-judicial bodies in the same manner as that of Section 14. 64. The decision of this Court in Ganesan v. Commission, Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Board and Others reported in (2019) 7 SCC 108 was directly concerned with the applicability of Section 5 of the Act, 1963 to appeal proceedings before a statutory authority and also had the opportunity to look into the decision in M.P. Steel (supra). Despite this, Ganesan (supra) arrived at the conclusion that the ratio of M.P. Steel (supra) had no application to their case since it pertained to Section 14 and not Section 5 of the Act, 1963. Therefore, it refused to condone delay by briefly observing as follows: \"44.The two-Judge Bench inM.P. Steel Corpn.[M.P. Steel Corpn.v.CCE, (2015) 7 SCC 58 : (2015) 3 SCC (Civ) 510] , however, held that the provisions of Section 14 would certainly apply. We in the present case are concerned only with applicability of Section 5 of the Limitation Act.\" 65. The aforesaid approach taken in Ganesan (supra), by itself, is sufficient indication that the principles underlying Section 5 of the Act, 1963 cannot be applied to quasi-judicial bodies. However, to obviate any further confusion on this legal issue, we would like to take forward this conclusion arrived at in Ganesan (supra) a bit further and elucidate why the treatment as regards the principles underlying Sections 5 and 14 of the Act, 1963 respectively, must be different. i. The difference between the principles underlying Sections 5 and 14 of the Act, 1963 respectively 66. Section 5 of the Act, 1963, with which we are directly concerned, reads thus: \"5. Extension of prescribed period in certain cases.-- Any appeal or any application, other than an application under any of the provisions of Order XXI of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), may be admitted after the prescribed period if the appellant or the applicant satisfies the court that he had sufficient cause for not preferring the appeal or making the application within such period. [2026] 1 S.C.R. 267 The Property Company (P) Ltd. v. Rohinten Daddy Mazda Explanation.--The fact that the appellant or the applicant was misled by any order, practice or judgment of the High Court in ascertaining or computing the prescribed period may be sufficient cause within the meaning of this section.\" 67. The marginal note to Section 5 reads - \"Extension of prescribed period in certain cases\". Therefore, it is limpid that what the provision contemplates is the \"extension\" of the prescribed period of limitation and not the exclusion of it. 68. It is also well-established that the term \"sufficient cause\" under Section 5 must not be subject to undue rigidity and must be construed in a manner such that it can be contextualised in the facts and circumstances of each case. In other words, it must be kept sufficiently flexible and not be subject to an exhaustive set of circumstances or reasons. Courts must adopt a liberal and justice-oriented approach in assessing whether sufficient cause is made out. While there exists some outer boundaries within which the term \"sufficient cause\" must be construed, yet it is no doubt true that a significant amount of leeway is given to courts which are faced with an application under Section 5 of the Act, 1963 to ascertain whether the reasons assigned qualify the subjective test of the words \"sufficient cause\". 69. Furthermore, the use of the words \"may be admitted\" in the substantive part of the provision indicates that the power which is vested with the court to admit an appeal or an application after the prescribed period, upon sufficient cause being established, is discretionary in nature. There is not one but a two-layered exercise of discretion which is involved in a Section 5 application - i.e., first, in determining whether \"sufficient cause\" existed and when the same is answered in the affirmative, then, secondly, in assessing whether the case is a fit one for the extension of time/condonation of delay [See: Shivamma (Dead) by LRs v. Karnataka Housing Board reported in 2025 SCC OnLine SC 1969] 70. In contradistinction, Section 14 of the Act, 1963 reads thus: \"14. Exclusion of time of proceeding bona fide in court without jurisdiction.--(1) In computing the period of limitation for any suit the time during which the plaintiff has been prosecuting with due diligence another civil proceeding, whether in a court of first instance or of appeal or revision, against the defendant shall be excluded, where\n\n268 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports the proceeding relates to the same matter in issue and is prosecuted in good faith in a court which, from defect of jurisdiction or other cause of a like nature, is unable to entertain it. (2) In computing the period of limitation for any application, the time during which the applicant has been prosecuting with due diligence another civil proceeding, whether in a court of first instance or of appeal or revision, against the same party for the same relief shall be excluded, where such proceeding is prosecuted in good faith in a court which, from defect of jurisdiction or other cause of a like nature, is unable to entertain it. (3) Notwithstanding anything contained in rule 2 of Order XXIII of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), the provisions of sub-section (1) shall apply in relation to a fresh suit instituted on permission granted by the court under rule 1 of that Order, where such permission is granted on the ground that the first suit must fail by reason of a defect in the jurisdiction of the court or other cause of a like nature. Explanation.--For the purposes of this section,-- (a) in excluding the time during which a former civil proceeding was pending, the day on which that proceeding was instituted and the day on which it ended shall both be counted; (b) a plaintiff or an applicant resisting an appeal shall be deemed to be prosecuting a proceeding; (c) misjoinder of parties or of causes of action shall be deemed to be a cause of a like nature with defect of jurisdiction.\" 71. The marginal note to Section 14 reads - \"Exclusion of time of proceeding bona fide in court without jurisdiction\". Therefore, at first blush, what becomes evident is that the provision is concerned with \"exclusion\" and not \"extension\". 72. On a further reading of the aforesaid, one can see that there are certain well-defined pre-requisites that must be satisfied for a party [2026] 1 S.C.R. 269 The Property Company (P) Ltd. v. Rohinten Daddy Mazda to take benefit of Section 14. Section 14(2) deals with computing the period of limitation for an application and the following are its requisite conditions - First, both the earlier and the subsequent proceedings must be civil proceedings; Secondly, both the earlier and the subsequent proceedings must be before a court; Thirdly, they must be between the same parties; Fourthly, they must be for the same relief; Fifthly, the previous proceedings must have been incapable of being entertained owing to a defect of jurisdiction or any other cause of a like nature; Lastly, the earlier proceedings must have been prosecuted with good faith and due-diligence. 73. Insofar as the second condition referred to above is concerned i.e., that both the earlier and the subsequent proceedings must be before a court, this Court in M.P. Steel (supra) clarified that the word \"court\" in Section 14 has now been expanded to include tribunals as well, but only insofar as the abortive proceeding is concerned. In other words, the application under Section 14 must still be made before a \"civil court\" or a court as understood in the traditional sense, but the time which is sought to be excluded may pertain to proceedings undertaken before a quasi-judicial forum. It was observed thus: \"34.[…] This Court made a distinction between \"civil court\" and \"court\" and expanded the scope of Section 14 stating that any authority or tribunal having the trappings of a court would be a \"court\" within the meaning of Section 14. It must be remembered that the word \"court\" refers only to a proceeding which proves to be abortive. In this context, for Section 14 to apply, two conditions have to be met. First, the primary proceeding must be a suit, appeal or application filed in a civil court. Second, it is only when it comes to excluding time in an abortive proceeding that the word \"court\" has been expanded to include proceedings before tribunals.\" (Emphasis supplied) 74. Another pertinent aspect under Section 14(2) is the use of the words \"shall be excluded\" which indicates that the provision is couched in mandatory language. Meaning thereby that, when the defined conditions or pre-requisites of Section 14(2) are satisfied, the court would be obligated to exclude the time concerned and it would not\n\n270 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports be open for the court to disallow the Section 14(2) application for any ancillary reason. 75. What flows from this preliminary examination of Sections 5 and 14 of the Act, 1963 respectively, is that - First, one pertains to the exercise of a discretionary power vested in courts and the other is a mandatory provision independent of any exercise of discretion; Secondly, one refers to \"sufficient cause\" which term by itself is subject to a good amount of elasticity and the other has delineated well-defined conditions which must be met; and Lastly, one deals with the extension of time while the other is concerned with the exclusion of time. 76. One common aspect that cuts through both provisions is, of course, that both have been enacted to advance the cause of substantial justice. However, we must be mindful in equating, without distinction, the principles underlying Sections 5 and 14 of the Act, 1963 respectively and erasing the very apparent differences which exist between the two provisions. 77. In this context, it would be apposite to point out that a three-judge bench of this Court in Consolidated Engineering Enterprises v. Principal Secretary, Irrigation Department and Others reported in (2008) 7 SCC 169 indicated that the principles underlying Sections 5 and 14 of the Act, 1962 respectively, stand on a different footing. It was emphasized that while the power to excuse delay and grant extension of time under Section 5 is discretionary, the power to exclude time under Section 14 is mandatory when the necessary ingredients are fulfilled. Section 5 is much broader in scope because a multitude of reasons could constitute \"sufficient cause\" for the purpose of condonation or extension. The relevant observations are thus: \"28.Further, there is fundamental distinction between the discretion to be exercised under Section 5 of the Limitation Act and exclusion of the time provided in Section 14 of the said Act. The power to excuse delay and grant an extension of time under Section 5 is discretionary whereas under Section 14, exclusion of time is mandatory, if the requisite conditions are satisfied. Section 5 is broader in its sweep than Section 14 in the sense that a number of widely different reasons can be advanced and established to show that there was sufficient cause in not filing the [2026] 1 S.C.R. 271 The Property Company (P) Ltd. v. Rohinten Daddy Mazda appeal or the application within time. The ingredients in respect of Sections 5 and 14 are different. The effect of Section 14 is that in order to ascertain what is the date of expiration of the \"prescribed period\", the days excluded from operating by way of limitation, have to be added to what is primarily the period of limitation prescribed. […].\" (Emphasis supplied) 78. One might still take the view that the difference between extension and exclusion is only semantic. However, such a view would seriously misconstrue the plain language and intent underlying these two provisions. On the one hand, when the court extends time under Section 5, what essentially occurs is that the applicant is required to satisfy the court about the existence of a sufficient cause starting from the date on which limitation began till the actual date of filing. Upon being satisfied about the existence of sufficient cause, the court then extends the prescribed period of limitation itself till the date of filing of the appeal or application, as the case may be, such that the appeal or application is deemed to have been filed within limitation, under the eyes of law. In other words, the non-filing of the appeal or the application within prescribed period of limitation is only excused and the mandatory bar under Section 3 of the Act, 1963 is overcome by stretching out the prescribed period of limitation, through discretion, in the peculiar facts and circumstances of each case. 79. On the other hand, when the court is contemplating the exclusion of time under Section 14, the prescribed period of limitation continues to be unaltered. What happens is that, in computing the limitation period, the time during which the applicant was prosecuting the abortive proceeding is altogether excluded. This is substantiated by the observation of this Court in M.P. Steel (supra) that - \"when a certain period is excluded, by applying the principles contained in Section 14, there is no delay to be attributed to the appellant, and the limitation period provided by the statute concerned continues to be the stated period and not more than the stated period.\". 80. The effect of the exclusion is, therefore, that, the applicant or the appellant, as the case may be, is placed in a position wherein it is assumed that the abortive proceeding never even occurred in the first place. The law permits such an assumption if the ingredients under Section 14 are satisfied. There arises no question of stretching 272 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports out the prescribed period of limitation through discretion. It is as though the time during which the abortive proceeding was prosecuted is expunged in the eyes of law. Such an erasure is allowed also because no delay could be said to be attributed to the applicant or the appellant, as the case may be. 81. However, when an extension occurs under Section 5, the delay is, in clear terms, attributed to the applicant or the appellant, as the case may be. It is just that such a delay does not have the consequence of the application or the appeal being disallowed due to the mandate under Section 3 of the Act, 1963. The effect of Section 5 is that the period during which the sufficient cause persisted is not erased in the eyes of law; rather the prescribed period of limitation is discretionarily adjusted for the benefit of the litigant. 82. In simple terms, it could be said that, under Section 5, it is the limitation period itself which is being discretionarily extended; whereas, under Section 14, the clock is reversed and the litigant's position is restored to some specific date which is within the prescribed period of limitation. After being placed back within the prescribed period of limitation, the litigant would thereafter be \"entitled\" to file the appeal or application, as the case may be, as a \"matter of right\". There arises no such question of right insofar as the mechanism contemplated under Section 5 is concerned. Under Section 5, even after satisfying the court that sufficient cause existed, the litigant cannot claim the extension as a matter of right, since it is the exercise of discretion which is the decisive factor. 83. To illustrate, if the prescribed period of limitation for preferring some appeal/application is 180 days, and say, the litigant prefers the same appeal/application on the 300th day - Here, the effect of Section 5 would be that, if sufficient cause existed, the limitation period itself is extended such that it becomes 300 days. Now consider the same appeal/application for which the prescribed period of limitation is 180 days, and say, the applicant was prosecuting an abortive proceeding from the 120th day - Here, the effect of a Section 14 application would be that, if its pre-requisites are fulfilled, the clock is turned back and the applicant is placed, yet again, on the 120th day i.e., the date on which he could file the same appeal/application as a matter of right. 84. This nuanced distinction between extension and exclusion is relevant for our discussion on whether the principles underlying Sections [2026] 1 S.C.R. 273 The Property Company (P) Ltd. v. Rohinten Daddy Mazda 5 and 14 of the Act, 1963 could both be analogously applied to proceedings before quasi-judicial bodies because, as aforementioned, under Section 5, the courts exercise discretion in extending and more specifically, adjusting the prescribed period of limitation itself to create a fresh period of limitation. Whereas, insofar as Section 14 is concerned, the prescribed period of limitation remains intact. The mechanism envisaged under Section 5 is proximally bound and tethered to the discretion with which a civil court is empowered and that under Section 14 is anchored on restoring the right of a litigant to institute an appeal or application, as the case may be, within the prescribed period of limitation. This restoration is based on fixed and well-defined conditions which leaves no room for any exercise of discretion. In other words, Section 14 allows the litigant to file the appeal or the application, as the case may be, as a matter of right by reinstating him on a specific point in the timeline wherein he is entitled to exercise the said right, whereas Section 5 acknowledges that he may not be entitled as a matter of right to file the appeal or the application, as the case may be, but extends time in his favour due to some inherent discretion vested in civil courts. 85. Both provisions work in the interest of the litigant and seek to further the cause of substantive justice, however, the kind and nature of the power exercised under the two provisions, as well as the mechanism envisaged therein, are quite distinct. 86. Another key difference between Sections 5 and 14 of the Act, 1963 respectively was pointed out by the decision of this Court in Sakaru v. Tanaji reported in (1985) 3 SCC 590. While Section 14 pertains to \"computation of the period of limitation\", Section 5 is a provision that comes into play once such a computation is already completed and the appeal or the application, as the case may be, is still beyond the prescribed period of limitation. To put it simply, the discretion to 'extend' time can only be contemplated once the process of computation (which includes 'exclusion' of time) is done with. The relevant observations are thus: 3. […] The provisions relating to computation of the period of limitation are contained in Sections 12 to 24 included in Part III of the Limitation Act, 1963. Section 5 is not a provision dealing with \"computation of the period of limitation\". It is only after the process of computation is 274 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports completed and it is found that an appeal or application has been filed after the expiry of the prescribed period that the question of extension of the period under Section 5 can arise.\" (Emphasis supplied) 87. Despite the differences delineated above, as a last resort, one could possibly cite the discussion undertaken by this Court in M.P. Steel (supra) whereby, Sections 6 and 14 of the Act, 1963 and their underlying principles were equated and it was stated that both can be analogously applied to quasi-judicial bodies. Moreover, one would also be right in pointing out that while Section 14 is a computation provision, Section 6 is not. In that context, the question would arise as to why the rationale adopted for Section 6 cannot be true for Section 5 as well? 88. We are of the view that there exist several identical features between Sections 6 and 14 of the Act, 1963 respectively and the same identity cannot be said to exist vis-á-vis Section 5. Section 6 which deals with \"legal disability\" is similar to Section 14 on several aspects - First, it is also a provision which envisages 'exclusion of time' and has nothing to do with extension of time. Secondly, the provision is also mandatory in nature and the use of the word \"may\" does not refer to the discretion granted to the court, but rather, the discretion given to the litigant to institute a suit or an application, as the case may be. Thirdly, it also indicates that after the period during which the legal disability persisted is excluded, the litigant is entitled to institute the suit or the application, as the case may be, as a \"matter of right\". This is evident from the use of the words \"Where a person entitled…, as would otherwise have been allowed\". 89. As we have explained in the preceding paragraphs, such points of identity does not exist vis-á-vis Section 5. 90. In light of all the aforesaid, it is our view that the discretionary power to adjust the period of limitation itself, must be specifically granted to the concerned quasi-judicial body or tribunal and there must be a reasonable indication from the language of the statute that such a discretion which is otherwise vested in civil courts, is also vested in the concerned quasi-judicial body. We can think of two ways in which this can be done:\n\n[2026] 1 S.C.R. 275 The Property Company (P) Ltd. v. Rohinten Daddy Mazda a. Through a proviso or a sub-section in the concerned section stating that the quasi-judicial body can extend time for filing the said appeal or application, as the case may be, upon the satisfaction that sufficient cause existed. To illustrate, such a sub-rule or proviso may read thus - \"provided that the Company Law Board may, if it is satisfied that the appellant was prevented by sufficient cause from filing the appeal within the said period, allow it to be filed within a further period not exceeding 60 days\" or \"…within a further period of 60 days\" or \"…within a period of 60 days but not thereafter\". Courts have interpreted such provisions to confer a limited discretionary power to the quasi-judicial bodies to extend time. We say that it is limited because the exercise of such discretion is subject to an outer-limit (which is 60 days in our illustration). If no such outer-limit is prescribed, then the discretionary power to extend time would be unlimited. b. Through a separate provision within the scheme of the entire legislation stating that the quasi-judicial body would be able to apply the provisions of the Act, 1963 (akin to that of Section 433 of the Act, 2013). To illustrate, such a separate provision may read thus - \"The provisions of the Limitation Act, 1963 (36 of 1963) shall, as far as may be, apply to proceedings or appeals before the Company Law Board\". Such a provision would have empowered the CLB to exercise the discretionary power to apply Section 5 of the Act, 1963. We say so also because, at present, the NCLT and NCLAT do exercise their discretionary powers to extend time, as regards proceedings and appeals before themselves, due to the coming into force of Section 433 of the Act, 2013. The only restriction to the exercise of such a discretion would be an outer-limit, if any, indicated by the concerned provision, owing to the use of the words \"as far as may be\" in provisions like Section 433 of the Act, 2013. 91. To obviate any confusion, we have noted that the phrase \"as far as may be\", by itself, may not be sufficient to preclude the application 276 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports of Section 5 of the Act, 1963 altogether. The decision of this Court in Sesh Nath Singh and Another v. Baidyabati Sheoraphuli Co- operative Bank Limited and Another reported in (2021) 7 SCC 313 provides some important clarification in that regard. Section 238-A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (hereinafter, the \"IBC, 2016\") is pari materia to that of Section 433 of the Act, 2013 and also employs the phrase \"as far as may be\". In discussing the meaning of this expression, this Court pointed out that due to the existence of Section 238-A, the provisions of the Act, 1963, including that of Section 5, would apply to proceedings or appeals instituted under the IBC, 2016. In other words, the NCLT, NCLAT, DRT and DRAT respectively, could exercise their discretion to extend time insofar as the IBC, 2016 is concerned. The relevant observations are thus: \"56.For the sake of convenience, and to avoid prolixity and unnecessary repetition, all the aforesaid issues are dealt with together. Section 238-A IBC provides that the provisions of the Limitation Act shall, as far as may be, apply to proceedings before the adjudicating authority (NCLT) andNclat. 57.It is well settled by a plethora of judgments of this Court as also different High Courts and, in particular, the judgment of this Court inB.K. Educational Services (P) Ltd.v.Parag Gupta & Associates[B.K. Educational Services (P) Ltd.v.Parag Gupta & Associates, (2019) 11 SCC 633 : (2018) 5 SCC (Civ) 528] NCLT/Nclathas the discretion to entertain an application/appeal after the prescribed period of limitation. The condition precedent for exercise of such discretion is the existence of sufficient cause for not preferring the appeal and/or the application within the period prescribed by limitation.\" (Emphasis supplied) 92. However, suppose the concerned provision already provides that delay can only be condoned within a maximum outer-limit, then such an outer-limit would have to be harmoniously read with the expression \"as far as may be\" to curtail the power to exercise discretion in condoning delay within that outer-limit. [2026] 1 S.C.R. 277 The Property Company (P) Ltd. v. Rohinten Daddy Mazda 93. In the absence of any legislative intent being evident in the form of (a) or (b), it would not be proper for us to take the view that the principles underlying Section 5 must apply to such bodies, even by analogy. The argument that the principles underlying Sections 6 or 14 of the Act, 1963 respectively, could be applied to quasi-judicial bodies is not sufficient reason to hold the same insofar as Section 5 of the Act, 1963 is concerned. ii. The decision of this Court in International Asset Reconstruction Company of India Limited. 94. As indicated by us in the preceding paragraphs, whether the provisions of the Act, 1963 stand excluded and more particularly, whether there is an embargo on the application of Section 5 of the Act, 1963 must be examined conscientiously, keeping in mind the overall scheme of the Act in question and the intention of the legislature. The decision of a three-judge bench of this Court in International Asset Reconstruction Company of India Limited v. Official Liquidator of Aldrich Pharmaceuticals Limited and Others reported in (2017) 16 SCC 137 has shed light on how such an exercise is to be conducted. It dealt with the application of Section 5 of the Act, 1963 to an appeal before the Debt Recovery Tribunal (hereinafter, the \"DRT\") under Section 30 of the Recovery of Debts and Bankruptcy Act, 1993 (hereinafter, the \"Act, 1993\"). 95. It would be apposite to mention that Section 24 of the same Act read as follows: \"The provisions of the Limitation Act, 1963 (36 of 1963), shall, as far as may be, apply to an application made to a Tribunal.\" Upon a cursory reading of the aforesaid Section 24, one might assume that it is similar to that of Section 433 of the Act, 2013. However, a deeper analysis would reveal that while Section 433 of the Act, 2013 applies to \"proceedings or appeals\" before the NCLT or the NCLAT, Section 24 of the Act, 1993 applies only to an \"application\" made before the DRT. This was a crucial point of difference which proved to be instrumental to the issue with which International Asset Reconstruction Company (supra) was faced with, because it related to an 'appeal' and not an application made before the DRT. 96. Since the general rule is that the Act, 1963 would not apply to quasi-judicial bodies or tribunals, unless expressly specified, this Court turned its attention to any indication within the statute which 278 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports could signal that Section 5 of the Act, 1963 was intended to be applied to 'appeals' made before the DRT as well. In doing so, it was observed thus: \"13.The RDB Act is a special law. The proceedings are before a statutory Tribunal. The scheme of the Act manifestly provides that the legislature has provided for application of the Limitation Act to original proceedings before the Tribunal under Section 19 only. The Appellate Tribunal has been conferred the power to condone delay beyond 45 days under Section 20(3) of the Act. The proceedings before the Recovery Officer are not before a Tribunal. Section 24 is limited in its application to proceedings before the Tribunal originating under Section 19 only. The exclusion of any provision for extension of time by the Tribunal in preferring an appeal under Section 30 of the Act makes it manifest that the legislative intent for exclusion was express. The application of Section 5 of the Limitation Act by resort to Section 29(2) of the Limitation Act, 1963 therefore does not arise. The prescribed period of 30 days under Section 30(1) of the RDB Act for preferring an appeal against the order of the Recovery Officer therefore cannot be condoned by application of Section 5 of the Limitation Act.\" (Emphasis supplied) 97. It was observed that the power as regards condonation of delay was given to the DRT via Section 24 only when an original 'application' was made under Section 19 of the said Act and to the Appellate Tribunal via Section 20(3) when an appeal was made before it under Section 20. On the contrary, insofar as 'appeals' made to the DRT under Section 30 were concerned, it was held that the exclusion of Section 5 of the Act, 1963 was manifestly express. 98. The decision in International Asset Reconstruction Company (supra) furthers the proposition which has been well-cemented over the years that, one must carefully inspect and scrutinise the scheme of the Act and the intention of the legislature before conferring the power to extend time or condone delay to quasi-judicial bodies or tribunals. The exercise must be rooted in vigilance and not haste.\n\n[2026] 1 S.C.R. 279 The Property Company (P) Ltd. v. Rohinten Daddy Mazda iii. Whether the CLB Regulations confer any discretionary power to the CLB to extend time or condone delay under Section 5 of the Act, 1963? 99. In the facts and circumstances of the present case, the CLB seems to have traced its power to condone delay/extend time to Regulation 44 of the CLB Regulations. However, it is the submission of Ms. Nariman that the said regulation which saves the inherent powers of the CLB cannot be used to allow the circumvention of the mandatory time-limit prescribed for filing an appeal under Section 58 of the Act, 2013. Regulation 44 reads thus: \"44. Saving of inherent power of the Bench - Nothing in these rules shall be deemed to limit or otherwise affect the inherent power of the Bench to make such orders as may be necessary for the ends of justice or to prevent abuse of the process of the Bench.\" 100. It is well-established that although the exercise of inherent powers are in addition to the powers specifically conferred on the concerned body or institution, yet such an exercise of power must be complementary to and not be in conflict with any express provision or be contrary to the intention of the legislature. It is only when a provision is silent as regards some procedural aspect that the inherent power can come to the aid of the parties. One must be careful in ascertaining when there is an unintentional silence and when there exists a deliberate omission. 101. Moreover, this Court in Prakash H. Jain (supra) has already unequivocally stated that there cannot be any inherent power to extend the period of limitation prescribed for the filing of any appeal or application. 102. One could argue that it is the same inherent power which is exercised by a quasi-judicial body or tribunal when it applies the principles underlying Section 14 of the Act, 1963. However, as we have already explained, the principles underlying Sections 5 and 14 of the Act, 1963, could not be said to be on the same footing. 103. With respect to the issue with which we are concerned, we have already established that when the legislature has intended for a quasi-judicial body or a tribunal to apply the provisions of the Act, 1963, more particularly, confer the power of 'extension of time', they 280 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports have indicated the same in some way or the other, in an express manner. Regulation 44 cannot be resorted to in order to confer a power upon the CLB which the legislature in their wisdom did not intend to confer. 104. To buttress this line of reasoning further, let us look at Regulations 25 and 43 of the CLB Regulations respectively: \"25. Hearing of petition - The Bench may, if sufficient cause is shown at any stage of the proceeding grant time to the parties or any of them and adjourn the hearing of the petition or the application. The Bench may make such order as it thinks fit with respect to the costs occasioned by such adjournment. -xxx- 43. Enlargement of time - Where any period is fixed by or under these regulations or granted by a Bench, for the doing of any act, or filing of any documents or representation, the Bench, may, in its discretion, from time to time, enlarge such period, even though the period fixed by or under these regulations or granted by the Bench may have expired.\" 105. Regulation 25 deals with the discretion given to the CLB to grant additional time on an altogether different aspect. It deals with granting time, upon showing that sufficient cause existed, for the 'adjournment' of a hearing of the petition or application, as the case may be. One must not conflate this with the power to enlarge or extend time for the filing of the petition or application itself with is dealt with by the Act, 2013. 106. This is precisely why Regulation 43 which deals with the enlargement of time has also carefully used the words \"Where any period is fixed by or under these regulations or granted by a Bench…\". This makes it clearly evident that the discretion to enlarge time which is dealt with under the CLB Regulations pertain to those aspects which are dealt with under the CLB Regulations only or those otherwise granted by the Bench. They have no relation whatsoever with the prescribed period of limitation which governs the filing of the appeal or application under the Act, 2013 or its extension. 107. This discussion again goes to substantiate the view that, when the question is as regards the \"extension of time\" in the filing of an\n\n[2026] 1 S.C.R. 281 The Property Company (P) Ltd. v. Rohinten Daddy Mazda appeal or application itself, before a quasi-judicial body, we must be careful to not overread between the silences and instead, must look at whether there is any express indication to that effect. Whenever and wherever the legislature deemed it fit, it has granted either a limited or an unlimited power to extend time. d. How Section 58(3) of the Act, 2013 which is a simpliciter provision prescribing a limitation period, must be construed. 108. Section 58 of the Act, 2013 under which provision the respondent herein filed an appeal before the CLB, is reproduced as thus: \"58. Refusal of registration and appeal against refusal.-- (1) If a private company limited by shares refuses, whether in pursuance of any power of the company under its articles or otherwise, to register the transfer of, or the transmission by operation of law of the right to, any securities or interest of a member in the company, it shall within a period of thirty days from the date on which the instrument of transfer, or the intimation of such transmission, as the case may be, was delivered to the company, send notice of the refusal to the transfer or and the transferee or to the person giving intimation of such transmission, as the case may be, giving reasons for such refusal. (2) Without prejudice to sub-section (1), the securities or other interest of any member in a public company shall be freely transferable: Provided that any contract or arrangement between two or more persons in respect of transfer of securities shall be enforceable as a contract. (3) The transferee may appeal to the Tribunal against the refusal within a period of thirty days from the date of receipt of the notice or in case no notice has been sent by the company, within a period of sixty days from the date on which the instrument of transfer or the intimation of transmission, as the case may be, was delivered to the company. (4) If a public company without sufficient cause refuses to register the transfer of securities within a period of thirty 282 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports days from the date on which the instrument of transfer or the intimation of transmission, as the case may be, is delivered to the company, the transferee may, within a period of sixty days of such refusal or where no intimation has been received from the company, within ninety days of the delivery of the instrument of transfer or intimation of transmission, appeal to the Tribunal. (5) The Tribunal, while dealing with an appeal made under sub-section (3) or sub-section (4), may, after hearing the parties, either dismiss the appeal, or by order-- (a) direct that the transfer or transmission shall be registered by the company and the company shall comply with such order within a period of ten days of the receipt of the order; or (b) direct rectification of the register and also direct the company to pay damages, if any, sustained by any party aggrieved. (6) If a person contravenes the order of the Tribunal under this section, he shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than one year but which may extend to three years and with fine which shall not be less than one lakh rupees but which may extend to five lakh rupees.\" 109. Section 58(1) of the 2013 Act deals with a scenario wherein, a private company limited by shares, refuses to register the transfer or the transmission of the right to any securities or the interest of a member in the company, in favour of the transferee. This refusal may be in pursuance of any power of the company under its articles or otherwise. Such a refusal by the company must be made within a period of thirty days from the date on which the instrument of transfer or the intimation of such transmission, was delivered to the company. This refusal must be in the form of a reasoned notice, made either to the transferor and the transferee, or to the person giving intimation of the transmission to the company. 110. Section 58(3) is of particular significance to the present matter. It discusses the mechanism which must be adopted or the further course of action available to a transferee who is aggrieved by the decision of private company refusing to register the transfer or transmission of shares. According to Section 58(3), the transferee has to prefer\n\n[2026] 1 S.C.R. 283 The Property Company (P) Ltd. v. Rohinten Daddy Mazda an appeal before the NCLT (or the CLB during the period between 12.09.2013 and 01.06.2016) against the refusal of the company, within a period of thirty days from the date of receipt of the notice of refusal. In case no notice of refusal has been sent by the company, then the transferee has to prefer an appeal within a period of sixty days from the date on which the instrument of transfer or intimation of transmission was delivered to the company. 111. The entire question of how a particular provision of a special statute must be construed, for the purposes of limitation, directly arises as a consequence of the savings provision in the Act, 1963, which reads thus: \"29. Savings. - […] (2) Where any special or local law prescribes for any suit, appeal or application a period of limitation different from the period prescribed by the Schedule, the provisions of section 3 shall apply as if such period were the period prescribed by the Schedule and for the purpose of determining any period of limitation prescribed for any suit, appeal or application by any special or local law, the provisions contained in sections 4 to 24 (inclusive) shall apply only in so far as, and to the extent to which, they are not expressly excluded by such special or local law.\" 112. Section 29(2) states that, if any special or local law prescribes a certain period of limitation for any suit, appeal or application, as the case may be, which is different from that of the Schedule to the Act, 1963, then it is that period of limitation under the special or local law which must be looked into and not those periods which are prescribed under the Schedule to the Act, 1963. Through a deeming fiction, the period prescribed under that special or local law is considered to be that which is prescribed under the Schedule to the Act, 1963 for the purpose of application of Section 3 of the Act, 1963. 113. Moving further, apart from ascertaining what would be the prescribed period of limitation, more often than not, the question is also whether Section(s) 4 to 24 (both inclusive) of the Act, 1963 could be made applicable to that specific provision in the special or local law. For this purpose, one must examine whether the special or local law expressly excludes the application of Sections 4 to 24 of the Act, 1963. 284 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports 114. For example, take Section 34(3) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 with which this Court in Consolidated Engineering (supra) was concerned with. Ms. Arora has also laid particular emphasis on Section 34(3) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 to drive home her submission that there is no indication under Section 58(3) of the Act, 2013 which expressly excludes the application of Section 5 of the Act, 1963. Therefore, we deem it fit to explain the rationale underlying our reasoning using the same provision and it is reproduced as follows: \"(3) An application for setting aside may not be made after three months have elapsed from the date on which the party making that application had received the arbitral award or, if a request had been made under section 33, from the date on which that request had been disposed of by the arbitral tribunal: Provided that if the Court is satisfied that the applicant was prevented by sufficient cause from making the application within the said period of three months it may entertain the application within a further period of thirty days, but not thereafter.\" (Emphasis supplied) 115. In the said provision, the prescribed period of limitation for filing an application to set aside an arbitral award is three months. Therefore, if looked at from the lens of Section 29(2) of the Act, 1963, it would mean that instead of applying Article 137 of the Schedule to the Act, 1963 which prescribes a three-year limitation period, one must give priority to the period so specifically prescribed by the legislature under the special act, which is three months. 116. The proviso to Section 34(3) then states that, upon sufficient cause being shown, the application to set aside an arbitral award could be entertained within a further period of thirty days but not thereafter. In light of the language used, what then has to be determined is whether any provision within Sections 4 to 24 of the Act, 1963 was expressly excluded. 117. A reading of the proviso to Section 34(3) reveals that the application of Section 5 of the Act, 1963 has been restricted or rather, curtailed to [2026] 1 S.C.R. 285 The Property Company (P) Ltd. v. Rohinten Daddy Mazda an outer-limit of thirty days by the use of the phrase \"within a further period of thirty days but not thereafter\". In other words, in Section 34(3) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, Section 5 of the Act, 1963 which pertains to extension of time upon the showing of sufficient cause, is only applicable to a limited extent and is confined to that thirty-day additional period. The same was buttressed in the decision of this Court in Simplex Infrastructure Limited v. Union of India reported in (2019) 2 SCC 455. 118. However, insofar as Section 14 of the Act, 1963 was concerned, this Court in Consolidated Engineering (supra) held that it has not been expressly excluded by Section 34(3) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 and could apply to its fullest extent i.e., even without any outer-limit. 119. What the aforesaid example indicates is that the question of whether a certain provision in a special or a local law expressly excludes the provisions of Section 4 to 24 of the Act, 1963 arises only in pursuance of the savings provision under Section 29(2) of the Act, 1963. As a natural corollary, if Section 29(2) is, by itself, inapplicable to a particular case then there would be no need to look into or analyse whether there is any express exclusion. 120. This Court in Ganesan (supra) has unequivocally held that Section 29(2) of the Act, 1963 only relates to those provisions in the special or local law which deal with suits, applications or appeals, which are to be filed before a 'court'. Therefore, when a special or a local law deals with the filing of a suit, application or appeal, as the case may be, before quasi-judicial bodies or tribunals, the savings provision in Section 29(2) of the Act, 1963 does not have any relevance. The relevant observations are reproduced hereinbelow: \"60.1.The applicability of Section 29(2) of the Limitation Act is with regard to different limitations prescribed for any suit, appeal or application when to be filed in a court. 60.2.Section 29(2) cannot be pressed in service with regard to filing of suits, appeals and applications before the statutory authorities and tribunals provided in a special or local law. The Commissioner while hearing of the appeal under Section 69 of the 1959 Act is not entitled to condone 286 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports the delay in filing appeal, since, provision of Section 5 shall not be attracted by strength of Section 29(2) of the Act.\" (Emphasis supplied) 121. M.P. Steel (supra) had also indicated that which was subsequently laid down in Ganesan (supra) and stated that the special or local law referred to in Section 29(2) of the Act, 1963 must concern itself with a suit, application or appeal of the nature described in the Schedule to the Act, 1963 i.e., those that are filed before 'courts'. Therefore, Section 29(2) would not get attracted when the suit, application or appeal referred to in the special law relates to those which are made before quasi-judicial bodies. The relevant observations are thus: \"33. […] A bare reading of this section would show that the special or local law described therein should prescribe for any suit, appeal or application a period of limitation different from the period prescribed by the Schedule. This would necessarily mean that such special or local law would have to lay down that the suit, appeal or application to be instituted under it should be a suit, appeal or application of the nature described in the Schedule. We have already held that such suits, appeals or applications as are referred to in the Schedule are only to courts and not to quasi- judicial bodies or tribunals. It is clear, therefore, that only when a suit, appeal or application of the description in the Schedule is to be filed in a court under a special or local law that the provision gets attracted.[…]\" (Emphasis supplied) 122. In the example which we had discussed, the provision in the special law i.e., Section 34(3) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, was one which dealt with an application to be made before a 'court'. It fell within the scope of Section 29(2) of the Act, 1963 and therefore, one could indulge with the aspect of express exclusion with respect to Section 34(3) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. 123. In the present case, we need not undertake any exhaustive examination as to whether Section 58(3) of the Act, 2013 expressly excludes the application of Section 5 of the Act, 1963 because of the non-application of Section 29(2) of the Act, 1963. The non-application [2026] 1 S.C.R. 287 The Property Company (P) Ltd. v. Rohinten Daddy Mazda of Section 29(2) of the Act, 1963 is in turn owing to Section 58(3) of the Act, 2013 being concerned with an appeal which is to be made before a quasi-judicial body and not before a 'court'. 124. The general rule as regards any appeal or application filed before a 'court' is that the provisions of the Act, 1963 would apply, unless indicated otherwise. This is precisely why one enters into the debate of \"express exclusion\". However, the reverse is the general rule insofar as quasi-judicial bodies or tribunals are concerned i.e., that the provisions of the Act, 1963 do not apply, unless indicated otherwise. Therefore, the focus would shift to whether there is any \"express inclusion\" rather than an \"express exclusion\". An exception to this shift in focus, or in other words, a reason why one would still look at whether sections 4 to 24 of the Act, 1963 is \"expressly excluded\" is when the argument that the principles underlying certain provisions of the Act, 1963, like Section 6 or 14 must be made applicable to quasi-judicial bodies, succeeds or is being considered. This was the situation in Parson Tools (supra) and M.P. Steel (supra). However, we have assigned elaborate reasons as to why we are not inclined to apply the principles underlying Section 5 of the Act, 1963 to quasi- judicial bodies or tribunals. Therefore, there arises no occasion for us to explore this aspect of express exclusion. 125. In light of the aforesaid, we find no merit in the submission put forth by Ms. Arora that even before the coming into force of Section 433 of the Act, 2013, there was no express exclusion of the provisions of the Act, 1963 and therefore, the CLB could be said to have the power under Section 5 of the Act, 1963 to condone the delay in preferring the appeal under Section 58(3) of the Act, 2013. The absence of express exclusion, by itself, cannot be said to have conferred the CLB with the power to condone delay. 126. Having said the above, the next question which arises is regarding how the simpliciter limitation period prescribed under Section 58(3) of the Act, 2013, must be construed? To answer this, we find it apposite to bring forth certain observations made by this Court in Fairgrowth Investments Ltd v. Custodian reported in (2004) 11 SCC 472. The relevant observations are thus: \"9.We are of the view that the provision prescribing a time- limit for filing a petition for objection under Section 4(2) of the Act is mandatory in the sense that the period prescribed 288 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports cannot be extended by the court under any inherent jurisdiction of the Special Court. Prescribed periods for initiating or taking steps in legal proceedings are intended to be abided by, subject to any power expressly conferred on the court to condone any delay. Thus the Limitation Act, 1963 provides for different periods of limitation within which suits, appeals and applications may be instituted or filed or made as the case may be. It also provides for exclusion of time from the prescribed periods in certain cases, lays down bases for computing the period of limitation prescribed and expressly provides for extension of time under Section 5 in respect of certain proceedings. If the periods prescribed were not mandatory, it was not necessary to provide for exclusion or extension of time in certain circumstances nor would the method of computation of time have any meaning. 10.Section 4(2) of the Act plainly read simply requires a person objecting to a notification issued under sub-section (2) of Section 3 to file a petition raising such objections within 30 days of the issuance of such notification. The words are unequivocal and unqualified and there is no scope for reading in a power of court to dispense with the time-limit on the basis of any principle of interpretation of statutory provisions. InR. Rudraiahv.State of Karnataka[(1998) 3 SCC 23] it was contended on behalf of the appellants that Section 48-A of the Karnataka Land Reforms Act, 1961 which provided for the making of an application within a particular period should be construed liberally in favour of tenants so that the period was to be read as extendable. The submission was rejected on the ground that the language of Section 48-A was unambiguous and could not be interpreted differently only on the ground of hardship to the tenants. 11.The mere fact that the Special Court may have been imbued with the same status of a High Court would not alter the situation. We are of the view that it was not necessary for Section 4(2) of the Act to use additional peremptory language such as \"but not thereafter\" or \"shall\" to mandate that an objection had to be made within 30\n\n[2026] 1 S.C.R. 289 The Property Company (P) Ltd. v. Rohinten Daddy Mazda days. The mere use of the word \"may\" in Section 4(2) of the Act does not indicate that the period prescribed under the section is merely directory. The word \"may\" merely enables or empowers the objector to file an objection. The language in Section 4(2) of the Act may be compared with Sections 4 and 6 of the Limitation Act, 1963. Section 4 of the Limitation Act provides: \"4.Expiry of prescribed period when court is closed.--Where the prescribed period for any suit, appeal or application expires on a day when the court is closed, the suit, appeal or applicationmaybe instituted, preferred or made on the day when the court reopens.\" Certain sub-sections of Section 6 of the Limitation Act also provide for the period within which a minor or insane or an idiotmayinstitute suits. It cannot be contended that the word \"may\" in these sections indicates that the prescribed periods were merely directory. This Court inMangu Ramv. Municipal Corpn. of Delhi[(1976) 1 SCC 392 : 1976 SCC (Cri) 10] described statutory provisions of periods of limitation as \"mandatory and compulsive\" and also said: (SCC p. 397, para 7) \"It is because a bar against entertainment of an application beyond the period of limitation is created by a special or local law that it becomes necessary to invoke the aid of Section 5 (of the Limitation Act) in order that the application may be entertained despite such bar.\" 12.If the power to condone delay were implicit in every statutory provision providing for a period of limitation in respect of proceedings before courts, Section 29(2) of the Limitation Act, 1963 would be rendered redundant. We will discuss the scope and applicability of Section 29(2) in greater detail subsequently.\" (Emphasis supplied) 127. What we understand from the aforesaid observations in Fairgrowth (supra), is that: 290 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports i. First, the prescribed periods for the initiation or taking of any steps in pursuance of legal proceedings, even insofar as the traditional civil courts are concerned, are generally intended to be abided by. If in case all prescribed periods were not mandatory and only directory, then there would have been no necessity to provide for the exclusion or the extension of time under the Act, 1963 under certain circumstances and the method of computation of time would also not have any meaning. ii. Secondly, it is only after considering the mandatory nature of the prescribed periods that the civil court is empowered under Section 5 of the Act, 1963 to condone delay. If the said provision were not present then even civil courts would not have had the power to condone delay. Hence, any quasi-judicial body or tribunal which otherwise does not fall within the ambit of Section 5 of the Act, 1963 and which is also not specifically empowered to condone delay, cannot extend time under the notion that the prescribed period is only directory. iii. Thirdly, when the provision, in a plain, unequivocal and unqualified manner, states that something must be done within a said period of time, there would be no scope to read in any ancillary power to dispense with the said time-limit. The existence of any additional pre-emptory language in the form of \"but not thereafter\" or \"shall\" would not be necessary to convey the mandate of the prescribed period. iv. Lastly, the mere use of the word \"may\", in all situations, would not indicate that a period prescribed is merely directory. In a lot of contexts, the word \"may\" has been used to indicate the option available to a certain person to file an application, appeal or objection. To put it simply, it could just signify that someone would be enabled or empowered to do something. 128. Section 58(3) of the Act, 2013 uses the expression \"The transferee may appeal to the Tribunal\". As elucidated in Fairgrowth (supra), we are also of the view that the use of this word does not directly give rise to any inference that the limitation period prescribed therein is only directory. 129. Therefore, the respondent herein must have preferred his appeal under Section 58(3) of the Act, 2013 before the CLB, strictly within the time-limit prescribed therein. [2026] 1 S.C.R. 291 The Property Company (P) Ltd. v. Rohinten Daddy Mazda III. Whether Section 433 of the Act, 2013 must be made retrospectively applicable or the change in law during the pendency of the appeal must be taken into account in the facts and circumstances of the present case? 130. As indicated previously, Section 433 of the Act, 2013 was brought into force w.e.f 01.06.2016 i.e., from the same date on which the NCLT and the NCLAT respectively came to be constituted. In the phased manner of implementation of the provisions of the Act, 2013, such a decision to time the coming into force of Section 433 in a way that coincides with the creation of the NCLT and NCLAT respectively, was clear and conscious. This, by itself, is a good indication to steer away from the retrospective application of Section 433 in favour of the CLB. 131. Further, in the course of our initial discussion on whether the provisions of the Act, 1963 could, per say, be said to apply to quasi-judicial bodies, we had also indicated that the jurisprudence surrounding the application of the Act, 1963 is body/institution specific. In other words, the first step in approaching all such matters is to see whether the concerned body could be said to be a 'civil court' or not. If answered in the negative, then the endeavour is to figure out whether that body has been specifically empowered to apply the provisions of the Act, 1963. The general rule insofar as quasi-judicial bodies or tribunals are concerned, is that the provisions of the Act, 1963 do not apply unless indicated otherwise. Therefore, \"express inclusion\" as we had indicated earlier, must be present. 132. It is in this background that we are of the view that Section 433 which empowers the NCLT and the NCLAT respectively to apply the provisions of the Act, 1963, as far as may be, to proceedings and appeals before itself, cannot be borrowed to signify the existence of a similar power with respect to the CLB. Although much of what the CLB was doing earlier is being done by the NCLT presently, both are different bodies, created at different times and endowed with different powers. 133. We had also contemplated on whether the period between 12.09.2013 and 01.06.2016 should be treated differently and whether the powers exercised by the NCLT by virtue of Section 433 of the Act, 2013 must be extended to the CLB during this specific window of time. However, the scheme of the Act, 2013 and the manner in which it was implemented leaves no room for such an interpretation. It was fairly 292 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports clear that it was the CLB which would function as the adjudicating authority in respect of several matters during this period until the NCLT was created and there remained no confusion on whether the CLB's powers had been enhanced in any manner or not. 134. In B.K. Educational Services Private Limited v. Parag Gupta and Associates reported in (2019) 11 SCC 633, the question admittedly related to the retrospective application of Section 238-A of the IBC, 2016 which provision was pari materia to Section 433 of the Act, 2013. However, the background in which it was raised was altogether different. 135. The issue in B.K. Educational Services (supra) was whether Section 238-A of the IBC, 2016 (pari materia to Section 433 of the Act, 2013) which was inserted through the Amendment Act of 2018 with effect from 06.06.2018 could be said to have retrospective application from the date of commencement of the IBC, 2016 i.e. from 01.12.2016. In examining the reason behind the introduction of Section 238-A, it was culled out that the legislature had always intended for the Act, 1963 and the rules of limitation to apply to the IBC, 2016, especially with respect to the applications filed under Sections 7 and 9 of the IBC, 2016 respectively. In other words, the issue therein related to the retrospective application of the provision of an amending Act which was clarificatory in nature. 136. It is also of note that in B.K. Educational Services (supra), in the period between 01.12.2016 and 06.06.2018 i.e., the period for which retrospective application was sought, it was still the NCLT that was hearing applications under Sections 7 and 9 of the IBC, 2016 respectively. To put it simply, it was not a case wherein a different body was adjudicating the applications filed under Sections 7 and 9 respectively during 06.06.2018 and 01.12.2016. The issue was simple - when the NCLT was explicitly empowered to apply the provisions of the Act, 1963 on and after 06.06.2018 by way of Section 238-A of the IBC, 2016, could it be said that the NCLT also would have been empowered to apply the Act, 1963 before 06.06.2018?. This was what was answered in the affirmative. 137. Moreover, one another significant aspect in B.K. Educational Services (supra) was that, as on 01.06.2016, the NCLT was already empowered under Section 433 of the Act, 2013 to apply the provisions of the Act, 1963. This power of the NCLT was said to apply even [2026] 1 S.C.R. 293 The Property Company (P) Ltd. v. Rohinten Daddy Mazda when the NCLT decided applications under Sections 7 and 9 of the IBC, 2016 respectively. The same is evident from the observation in B.K. Educational Services (supra) that - \"Given the fact that the \"procedure\" that would apply to NCLT would be the procedure contained inter alia in the Limitation Act, it is clear that NCLT would have to decide applications made to it under the Code in the same manner as it exercises its other jurisdiction under the Companies Act.\" 138. In light of all these differences, any reliance on B.K. Educational Services (supra) to further the argument that Section 433 of the Act, 2013 must be applied to the CLB, would be unfounded. 139. This issue may be viewed at from one another angle. It is no more res integra that limitation being a procedural law, a change in law in that regard applies retrospectively. However, this general principle has certain exceptions - (a) the new law of limitation providing for a longer period cannot revive a dead remedy and, (b) the new law of limitation cannot suddenly extinguish a vested right of action by providing for a shorter period of limitation. 140. Some pertinent observations in this regard was made by the decision of this Court in Thirumalai Chemicals Limited v. Union of India and Others reported in (2011) 6 SCC 739 and the same is reproduced as follows: \"Law of limitation 29.Law of limitation is generally regarded as procedural and its object is not to create any right but to prescribe periods within which legal proceedings be instituted for enforcement of rights which exist under substantive law. On expiry of the period of limitation, the right to sue comes to an end and if a particular right of action had become time-barred under the earlier statute of limitation the right is not revived by the provision of the latest statute. Statutes of limitation are thus retrospective insofar as they apply to all legal proceedings brought after their operation for enforcing cause of action accrued earlier, but they are prospective in the sense that they neither have the effect of reviving the right of action which is already barred on the date of their coming into operation, nor do they have the effect of extinguishing a right of action subsisting on\n\n294 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports that date. Bennion onStatutory Interpretation, 5th Edn. (2008), p. 321 while dealing with retrospective operation of procedural provisions has stated that provisions laying down limitation periods fall into a special category and opined that although prima facie procedural, they are capable of effectively depriving persons of accrued rights and therefore they need be approached with caution. -xxx- 32.Limitation provisions therefore can be procedural in the context of one set of facts but substantive in the context of different set of facts because rights can accrue to both the parties. In such a situation, test is to see whether the statute, if applied retrospectively to a particular type of case, would impair existing rights and obligations. An accrued right to plead a time bar, which is acquired after the lapse of the statutory period, is nevertheless a right, even though it arises under an Act which is procedural and a right which is not to be taken away pleading retrospective operation unless a contrary intention is discernible from the statute. Therefore, unless the language clearly manifests in express terms or by necessary implication, a contrary intention a statute divesting vested rights is to be construed as prospective.\" (Emphasis supplied) 141. What is therefore evident is that, if the retrospective application of a procedural law, including that of limitation, affects or divests vested rights, the general rule that procedural law must be given retrospective effect, could be deviated from. In such cases, giving prospective effect may be favoured even if the matter pertains to limitation. However, if no such vested right could be said to exist, then giving retrospective effect is the way to go. 142. In Thirumalai Chemicals (supra), the cause of action arose when the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973 (hereinafter, the \"FERA\") was in force, but the impugned orders were issued when the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (hereinafter, the \"FEMA\") was in force. The difference in the two regimes insofar as the limitation period for filing an appeal was concerned was that, in the former regime, the prescribed period of limitation was 45 days and delay could be [2026] 1 S.C.R. 295 The Property Company (P) Ltd. v. Rohinten Daddy Mazda condoned upon sufficient cause being shown for an additional period of 90 days. In the latter regime, the prescribed period of limitation was 45 days and delay could be condoned upon sufficient cause being shown without any outer-limit. The appeal therein was admittedly belated. The issue related to whether the power to condone delay under the old regime or the new regime must be looked at. 143. In Thirumalai Chemicals (supra), this Court applied the provisions of the new regime based on the general principle that matters of procedure, including limitation, are to be given retrospective effect. Moreover, since the impugned orders were issued when the new regime was already in force, there was no vested right which accrued to the opposite party to plead any time bar in filing the appeal based on the old regime. In other words, the opposite party did not have any vested right to claim that delay could not be condoned beyond a period of 90 days as laid out in the old regime. 144. The facts and circumstances of the present case are slightly different from that in Thirumalai Chemicals (supra). As aforementioned, the newer law of limitation which is applicable to the matter cannot revive a dead remedy. In the facts of our case, the appellant company issued its notice refusing to register the transmission of shares on 30.04.2013 i.e., during a time when the regime under the Erstwhile Act was in vogue. More specifically, it was Section 111(2) r/w Section 111(3) of the Erstwhile Act which governed the field. According to those provisions, the respondent herein must have preferred an appeal before the CLB within a period of two months from the date of the notice of refusal i.e., before 30.06.2013. It is not in dispute that the respondent failed to file such an appeal before 30.06.2013. There existed no power to condone delay with the CLB during this period. Therefore, the remedy under Section 111(2) r/w Section 111(3) of the Erstwhile Act was already dead, much before the coming into force of Section 58 of the Act, 2013 on 12.09.2013 let alone the coming into force of Section 433 of the Act, 2013 on 01.06.2016. 145. Hence, in such a scenario, it would not be permissible for one to say that the power to condone delay which has been given to the NCLT beginning from 01.06.2016 must enure to the benefit of an appeal which had become time-barred much before the commencement of the Act, 2013. If such an argument is accepted then it would have the consequence of affecting vested rights. 296 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports 146. In light of the aforesaid, we do not wish to engage in any further discussion on whether the change in law due to the coming into force of Section 433 of the Act, 2013 had any bearing on the present case. 147. Before we conclude, we deem it appropriate to discuss certain decisions of this Court and of the Calcutta High Court, upon which the impugned decision had placed considerable reliance. 148. First, is the decision of a three-judge bench of this Court in Canara Bank (supra) which dealt with whether the CLB could be considered to be a 'civil court' for the purposes of Section 9-A of the Special Court (Trial of Offences Relating to Transactions in Securities) Act, 1992 (hereinafter, the \"Act, 1992\"). Interestingly, this question was also raised in the background of Section 111(2) r/w Section 111(3) of the Erstwhile Act (now Section 58(3) of the Act, 2013). Therein, if the CLB was to be considered a 'civil court' for the purposes of Section 9-A of the Act, 1992, then its jurisdiction vis-à-vis a suit, claim or other legal proceeding that overlapped with those under the purview of the Special Court, would be affected. In other words, those matters could be transferred from the CLB to the Special Court. 149. Keeping in view the object of the Act, 1992, this Court thought it appropriate to attribute a wider meaning to the word 'civil court' used in Section 9-A to encompass not only the traditional courts of civil judicature but all bodies, both courts and tribunals, which act judicially to deal with matters and claims. This interpretation was tailored in light of the mischief which was sought to be curtailed and the remedy sought to be advanced by the Act, 1992. 150. Therefore, the decision in Canara Bank (supra) was very specific to the Act, 1992 and was given in the context of the peculiar legal issue involved therein i.e., transfer of proceedings from the CLB to the Special Court. This decision cannot come to the aid of the respondents for the proposition that the CLB must also be considered to be a 'court' for the purposes of the Act, 1963 and more specifically, for the purpose of condonation of delay/extension of time. 151. Secondly, the impugned decision has also placed considerable reliance on the Division Bench decision of the Calcutta High Court in Nupur Mitra (supra). Therein, the CLB was faced with an application under Section 111(4) of the Erstwhile Act for the rectification of the register (corresponding to Section 59 of the Act, 2013) and was not [2026] 1 S.C.R. 297 The Property Company (P) Ltd. v. Rohinten Daddy Mazda dealing with an appeal against the refusal to register the transfer or transmission of shares under Section 111(2) r/w Section 111(3) of the Erstwhile Act (corresponding to Section 58 of the Act, 2013). 152. This difference is crucial because under Section 111(4) of the Erstwhile Act and Section 59 of the Act, 2013, there is no period of limitation which has been prescribed by the legislature. In other words, the making of an application for the rectification of register under both the Erstwhile Act and the Act, 2013 is not bound by a specific time- limit. On the other hand, under Section 111(2) r/w Section 111(3) of the Erstwhile Act and Section 58(3) of the 2013, Act, there is a specific period within which an appeal against the refusal to register the transfer or transmission of shares has to be filed before the CLB or the NCLT. 153. We are not concerned with an appeal made under Section 59 of the Act, 2013 for the rectification of the register which has no prescribed period of limitation. Rather our focus is on Section 58 of the Act, 2013 under which the legislature has specified a particular time period within which an appeal must be preferred. Therefore, on this aspect alone, we are of the view that the observations of the Calcutta High Court in Nupur Mitra (supra) as regards limitation are of no relevance to the present matter. 154. Even otherwise, the decision in Nupur Mitra (supra) did not conclusively hold that the Act, 1963 would apply to an application for the rectification of register under Section 111(4) of the Erstwhile Act. It was stated that - \"Assuming that the Limitation Act, 1963 does apply, in the absence of a specific provision covering applications under section 111, the residuary article namely Article 137 would apply. If the cause of action arose in 1996 as claimed by the appellants, the application under section 111 having been filed in 1998 would be within time.\" This was also observed in light of the fact that, irrespective of whether the Act, 1963 applied or not, the conclusion was that the application under Section 111(4) therein was not time-barred. Therefore, we are not persuaded by the respondent's reliance on the observations made in Nupur Mitra (supra). 155. It was under such circumstances that this Court in Basubani Private Ltd. and Anr v. Nupur Mitra and Ors. (Civil Appeal Nos. 5063- 5064 of 1999) considered it appropriate to not interfere with the observations made in Nupur Mitra (supra). 298 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports 156. Lastly, considerable reliance was also placed on the decision of a Single Judge of the Calcutta High Court in Mackintosh (supra) wherein it was stated that although Section 58(4) of the Act, 2013 prescribes a certain time-limit within which an appeal must be filed, yet nothing could be said to prevent the CLB from receiving the appeal thereunder beyond the stipulated period. The reasoning underlying the said conclusion was two-fold - (a) it is judicially recognised that the principles contained in the Act, 1963 would be applicable to the matters before the CLB and, (b) the provision does not explicitly prohibit the receipt of an appeal thereunder after the expiry of the time-limit indicated therein. Insofar as the aforesaid two-pronged reasoning is concerned, we have already explained as to how the principles underlying Section 5 of the Act, 1963 stand on a different footing and also that the use of any additional pre-emptory language should not always be a requirement to read the prescribed period of limitation as mandatory. Therefore, we are unable to agree with the views expressed in Mackintosh (supra). 157. The decision in Mackintosh (supra) was challenged by way of an SLP before this Court in Mackintosh Burn Ltd. v. Sarkar and Chowdhury Enterprises Private Limited reported in (2018) 5 SCC 575. However, the main issue canvassed was whether the High Court must have decided the other questions of law which was raised in the statutory appeal, apart from the question of limitation. This Court answering in the affirmative stated that the High Court must have considered all the grounds taken by the appellant justifying their refusal to register the shares in favour of the respondent and not restricted itself to the sole question of whether the CLB could have received the appeal under Section 58(4) beyond the prescribed period therein. By observing so, this Court had answered certain other questions of law and remanded the matter to the NCLT for a decision on merits. 158. While remanding the matter, this Court did not explicitly express any agreement with the position as regards the power of the CLB to condone delay taken in Mackintosh (supra). 159. Ms. Nariman had also made certain submissions on the question whether the proceedings under Section 58(3) of the Act, 2013 are original proceedings in the nature of a suit or not, particularly because neither Section 5 of the Act, 1963 nor its principles could apply to proceedings which are of an original nature. However, having already [2026] 1 S.C.R. 299 The Property Company (P) Ltd. v. Rohinten Daddy Mazda reached the conclusion that neither Section 5 of the Act, 1963 nor its underlying principles could be said to be applicable to an appeal filed before the CLB under Section 58(3) of the Act, 2013 owing to it being a quasi-judicial body which has not been empowered to extend time or condone delay, there arises no need for us to address this additional submission. G. CONCLUSION 160. A conspectus of the legal and factual discussion on the power of the CLB to extend time or condone delay under Section 58(3) of the Act, 2013 is as follows: i. The appeal under Section 58(3) of the Act, 2013 preferred by the respondent herein was filed during the period between 12.09.2013 and 01.06.2016. Therefore, although the appeal was made under the new provision of the Act, 2013, yet the body/forum before which it was made i.e., the CLB, was one constituted under the provisions of the Erstwhile Act. According to Section 10E(4C) of the Erstwhile Act, the CLB was a court only in the restricted sense. There existed no express provision which empowered the CLB to apply the provisions of the Act, 1963 to the proceedings and appeals before itself. ii. In multiple decisions of this Court, notable and significant emphasis has been placed on which institution/body is seeking to employ the provisions of the Act, 1963 or exercise the powers conferred under the Act, 1963. iii. The provisions of the Act, 1963 (provisions that lay down a prescribed period of limitation as well as Sections 4 to 24 of the Act, 1963 respectively) would only apply to suits, applications or appeals, as the case may be, which are made under any law to 'courts' and not to those made before quasi-judicial bodies or tribunals, unless such quasi-judicial bodies or tribunals are specifically empowered in that regard. iv. In Officer on Special Duty (supra), Prakash H. Jain (supra) and Om Prakash (supra) respectively, this Court has unequivocally held that the power to extend time under Section 5 of the Act, 1963 cannot be resorted to by statutory authorities, quasi-judicial bodies or tribunals, unless expressly indicated. It has been clarified that when such authorities or bodies are deemed to be 300 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports a court for certain limited or specified purposes, such a legal fiction must not be extended beyond the purpose for which the fiction was created so as to confer powers under Section 5 of the Act, 1963 as well. v. In Parson Tools (supra) and M.P. Steel (supra) respectively, this Court has developed a body of jurisprudence indicating that the principles underlying Section 14 of the Act, 1963 could be applied to the provisions relating to quasi-judicial bodies, unless there is any express indication to the contrary in the wording and scheme of the said provision. However, there exists a vital distinction between the principles underlying Sections 5 and 14 respectively. vi. The differences between the principles underlying Sections 5 and 14 of the Act, 1963 respectively are as follows - First, one pertains to the exercise of a discretionary power vested in the courts and the other is a mandatory provision independent of any exercise of discretion; Secondly, one refers to \"sufficient cause\" which term by itself is subject to a good amount of elasticity and the other has delineated well-defined conditions which must be met; and Lastly, one deals with the extension of time while the other is concerned with the exclusion of time. vii. The principles underlying Sections 5 and 14 of the Act, 1963 respectively, cannot be analogously applied to proceedings before quasi-judicial bodies because in the former, the courts exercise their discretion in extending and more specifically, adjusting the prescribed period of limitation itself to create a fresh period of limitation. No entitlement as a matter of right arises vis-à-vis extension of time. Whereas, in the latter, the prescribed period of limitation remains intact, no delay is attributed to the litigant and the time during which the abortive proceeding was being prosecuted is expunged in the eyes of the law to place the litigant back or restore his position within the prescribed period of limitation wherein he is entitled to file the appeal or application, as the case may be, as a matter of right. viii. The mechanism envisaged under Section 5 is proximally bound and tethered to the discretion with which a civil court is empowered and that under Section 14 is anchored on restoring the right of a litigant to institute an appeal or application, as the [2026] 1 S.C.R. 301 The Property Company (P) Ltd. v. Rohinten Daddy Mazda case may be, within the prescribed period of limitation. Both provisions work in the interest of the litigant and seek to further the cause of substantive justice, however, the kind and nature of the power exercised under the two provisions, as well as the mechanism envisaged therein, are quite distinct. ix. Moreover, the principles underlying Sections 5 and 14 of the Act, 1963 respectively also stand on a different footing for the reason that when the legislature has intended to grant powers of extension of time, the same has been expressly indicated either through the manner in which the concerned provision is phrased (more often than not through a proviso) or by the adoption of the Act, 1963 through a separate provision to the special law as a whole (akin to Section 433 of the 2013, Act). x. Therefore, the decision of this Court in M.P. Steel (supra) would not apply analogously to a situation when the principles underlying Section 5 of the Act, 1963 are sought to be applied by quasi-judicial bodies which aren't empowered in that regard. xi. Regulation 44 of the CLB Regulations which saves the inherent power of the CLB would not enable the CLB to extend time for the filing of the appeal or the application itself, as the case may be. xii. In Ganesan (supra), it has been settled that the savings provision in the Act, 1963 i.e., Section 29(2), is of no relevance when the special or local law deals with a suit, appeal or application, as the case may be, which is to be filed before a quasi-judicial body. The question whether a certain provision in a special or a local law expressly excludes the provisions of Sections 4 to 24 of the Act, 1963 respectively arises only in pursuance of the savings provision under Section 29(2) of the Act, 1963. As a natural corollary, if Section 29(2) is, by itself, inapplicable to a particular case then there would be no need to look into or analyse whether there is any express exclusion. xiii. An exception to the aforesaid, i.e., a reason why one would still look at whether Sections 4 to 24 of the Act, 1963 respectively are \"expressly excluded\" irrespective of the application of Section 29(2) of the Act, 1963, is when the argument that the principles underlying those provisions of the Act, 1963, must be applied, is being explored. 302 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports xiv. Presently, we are dealing with an appeal under Section 58(3) of the Act, 2013 preferred before the CLB - a quasi-judicial body. We have also answered in the negative on the submission that the principles underlying Section 5 of the Act, 1963 must be applied. Section 29(2) of the Act, 1963 is, therefore, of no relevance and there arises no occasion to examine whether Section 58(3) of the Act, 2013 \"expressly excludes\" the application of Section 5 of the Act, 1963. xv. The simpliciter limitation period prescribed under Section 58(3) of the Act, 2013 must not be read to be merely directory. The presence of any additional pre-emptory language in the form of \"but not thereafter\" or \"shall\" would not always be necessary to convey that the prescribed period is mandatory. xvi. Section 433 of the Act, 2013 which empowers the NCLT and the NCLAT respectively to apply the provisions of the Act, 1963, as far as may be, to the proceedings and appeals before itself, cannot be borrowed to signify the existence of a similar power with respect to the CLB. Moreover, the remedy of the respondent was already time-barred before the coming into force of Section 58(3) of the Act, 2013, let alone the coming into force of Section 433 of the Act, 2013. Hence, the change in law cannot enure to the benefit of the present respondent. 161. In the overall view of the matter, we have reached the conclusion that the High Court could be said to have committed an error in dismissing the statutory appeal filed under Section 10F of the Erstwhile Act and thereby, affirming the order of the CLB condoning the delay of 249 days in filing the appeal under Section 58(3) of the Act, 2013. 162. In the result, this appeal succeeds and is hereby, allowed. The impugned judgement and order of the High Court is set-aside. 163. Pending applications, if any, shall also stand disposed of. Result of the case: Appeal allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain", "2026_1_24_29_EN_2026": "[2026] 1 S.C.R. 24 : 2026 INSC 10 Dharmendra Sharma v. M. Arunmozhi & Anr.

Furthermore, we refrain from imposing any exemplary costs on either party, recognising that both have contributed to the situation at hand.

The petitioner submits that although respondent no. 1 has complied with the remaining directions issued by this Court, namely, refunding the entire amount deposited by the petitioner along with interest at the rate of 9% per annum, and paying an additional sum of Rs. 15,00,000/- (Rupees Fifteen Lakhs only), however the respondent has failed to refund an amount of Rs. 3,99,100/- (Rupees Three Lakhs Ninety-Nine Thousand One Hundred only), being the cost of the non-judicial stamp papers purchased by the petitioner. It is further averred that, instead of refunding the said amount, respondent no. 1, on 7th December, 2024, returned the twenty-two original stamp papers, which had in the meanwhile expired, through postal communication.\n\n[2026] 1 S.C.R. 27 Dharmendra Sharma v. M. Arunmozhi & Anr. 4. According to the petitioner, he addressed representations to the Assistant Commissioner of Stamps, Agra, seeking refund of the amount paid towards the unused twenty-two original stamp papers. However, the Assistant Inspector General of Registration, Agra, by order dated 21st July, 2025, rejected the petitioner's request for refund of the stamp value, informing him that the same was not refundable. The relevant extract of the said order reads as under: - \"Regarding the refund of physical non-judicial stamp papers, it is regretfully informed that physical non-judicial stamp papers can be refunded within a maximum period of eight years from their date of purchase. . . . As it evident from the above, the concerned notification came into effect in the state from 20th December 2017, and it is clarified in the notification that no application for stamp refund will be accepted one year after the date of the amendment in cases where the decision for the stamp refund is required to be taken by the state government. You first submitted the application for the refund of the stamp value to this office on 20.12.2024. By that date, approximately 10 years had elapsed since you purchased the stamps. Therefore, following the notification passed by the state government in 2017, the prescribed eight- year period for stamp value refund had already expired and additionally, the final date for applying for the refund of old stamps which was 20th December 2018, had also passed. Thus, your right to a refund of the stamp value had become barred by limitation. You have also mentioned in your letter dated 26.06.2025 that in paragraph 23 of the judgment dated 06.09.2024passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, directions have been given to the Registration Department for the refund of the stamp value. In this context, the copy of the Hon'ble Supreme Court's judgment dated 06.09.2024, attached with the application, was perused. A perusal of paragraph 23 makes it clear that the Hon'ble Court has only ordered the Agra Development Authority to physically return the 28 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports stamp papers worth Rs.3,99,100 in its possession to the petitioner and there is no direction to the Registration Department for the refund of the stamp value. The Uttar Pradesh Stamp and Registration Department was not even included as a party in this civil appeal. Therefore, the order passed by the Hon'ble Court was applicable only to the Development Authority. The Stamp and Registration Department has no connection with it. Therefore, in view of the above legal circumstances, all applications submitted by you for the refund of the stamp value are rejected after consideration and it is also informed that the stamp value cannot be refunded to you under the rules by the state government. . . .\" 5. Aggrieved by the communication dated 21st July, 2025, the petitioner has instituted the present contempt petitions. 6. When the matter was taken up for hearing for the first time, having regard to the peculiar factual situation obtaining in the case, the petitioner sought leave to implead the State of Uttar Pradesh through the Collector, Agra, as a party to the proceedings. Vide order dated 14th October, 2025, such permission was granted and notice was issued in the contempt petitions. Consequently, the State of Uttar Pradesh has been impleaded as respondent no. 2 herein. 7. In the affidavit filed on behalf of respondent no. 2, it has been fairly submitted that the rejection of the petitioner's application for refund was founded on Rule 218 of the U.P. Stamp Rules, 1942 (as amended), which proscribes refund of physical non-judicial stamp papers after the expiry of a period of eight years. At the same time, respondent no. 2 has candidly conceded that the said action was taken on a bona fide interpretation of the aforesaid provision, has tendered an unconditional apology, and has further stated that respondent no. 2 remains duty-bound to implement the directions issued by this Court in the interest of justice. 8. Therefore, without entering into the merits of the issues that have subsequently arisen after the disposal of the original civil appeals, we are inclined to dispose of the present contempt petitions by issuing a direction simpliciter to respondent no. 2 to refund a sum\n\n[2026] 1 S.C.R. 29 Dharmendra Sharma v. M. Arunmozhi & Anr. of Rs. 3,99,100/- (Rupees Three Lakhs Ninety-Nine Thousand One Hundred only) to the petitioner, upon return of the non-judicial stamp papers received by him from respondent no. 1, within a period of two months from today. 9. The contempt petitions qua respondent no. 1 shall stand closed. 10. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of. Result of the case: Contempt petitions disposed of. †Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain", "2026_1_30_90_EN_2026": "[2026] 1 S.C.R. 30 : 2026 INSC 6 Bhadra International (India) Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. v.

[Para 123(i)] Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 - Sub-section (5) of s.12 and Seventh Schedule - When relationship falls within any of the categories specified in the Seventh Schedule: Held: Sub-section (5) of s.12 provides that any person whose relationship with the parties or counsel, or the dispute, whether direct or indirect, falls within any of the categories specified in the Seventh Schedule would be ineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator - Since, the ineligibility stems from the operation of law, not only is a person having an interest in the dispute or its outcome * Author\n\n[2026] 1 S.C.R. 31 Bhadra International (India) Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. v. Airports Authority of India ineligible to act as an arbitrator, but appointment by such a person would be ex facie invalid. [Para 123(ii)] Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 - Proviso to s.12(5) - The words \"an express agreement in writing\" in the proviso to s.12(5): Held: The words \"an express agreement in writing\" in the proviso to s.12(5) means that the right to object to the appointment of an ineligible arbitrator cannot be taken away by mere implication - The agreement referred to in the proviso must be a clear, unequivocal written agreement. [Para 123(iii)] Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 - s.12(5) - When an arbitrator is found to be ineligible by virtue of s.12(5) r/w. the Seventh Schedule: Held: When an arbitrator is found to be ineligible by virtue of s.12(5) r/w. the Seventh Schedule, his mandate is automatically terminated - In such circumstance, an aggrieved party may approach the court u/s. 14 r/w. s.15 for appointment of a substitute arbitrator - Whereas, when an award has been passed by such an arbitrator, an aggrieved party may approach the court u/s. 34 for setting aside the award. [Para 123(iv)] Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 - s.12 - Parties vest jurisdiction in the tribunal: Held: In arbitration, the parties vest jurisdiction in the tribunal by exercising their consent in furtherance of a valid arbitration agreement - An arbitrator who lacks jurisdiction cannot make an award on the merits - Hence, an objection to the inherent lack of jurisdiction can be taken at any stage of the proceedings. [Para 123(v)] Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 - sub-section (5) of s.12 and Seventh Schedule - Objective of s.12: Held: There is a conspectus of decisions of this Court which lay down that, s.12 was amended with the objective of ensuring independence and impartiality of arbitrators - By virtue of sub- section (5) of s.12, any person whose relationship with the parties or counsel, or the dispute, whether direct or indirect, falls within any 32 [2026] 1 S.C.R.

[Para 57] Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 - Unilateral appointments: Held: Unilateral appointments are not consistent with the basic tenet of arbitration, i.e., mutual confidence in the arbitrator - It would not be unreasonable for a party to apprehend that an arbitrator unilaterally appointed by the opposite party may not act with complete impartiality. [Para 58] Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 - s.12(5) - s.12(5) and unilateral appointment of an arbitrator: Held: It is apposite to understand that s.12(5) does not prohibit unilateral appointment of an arbitrator - It provides that whenever an appointment of an arbitrator is hit by the bar u/s.12(5), the arbitrator would be ineligible to act, irrespective of whether the appointment was unilateral or with consent of both parties - In such circumstances, the parties may, in the manner provided under the proviso, waive the ineligibility. [Para 60] Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 - s.12(5) - Unilateral appointment of a sole arbitrator is void ab initio: Held: The unilateral appointment of a sole arbitrator is void ab initio, and the sole arbitrator so appointed is de jure ineligible to act as an arbitrator in terms of s.12(5) r/w. the Seventh Schedule of the Act, 1996. [Para 68] Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 - s.21 - Clarification regarding notice u/s.21of the Act, 1996: Held: A notice u/s.21 of the Act, 1996, is an expression to set the arbitration agreement into motion upon arising of disputes between the parties - The section states that the date of commencement of [2026] 1 S.C.R. 33 Bhadra International (India) Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. v. Airports Authority of India arbitration would be the date on which the recipient receives the notice from the claimant that the dispute be referred to arbitration - The notice acts as a communication that the sender is aggrieved and seeks to invoke the arbitration agreement - It does not, by itself, operate as consent to any appointment to be made in the future. [Para 70] Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 - Proviso to s.12 (5) - Essentials of the proviso to s.12(5): Held: i) The parties can waive their right to object under sub- section (5) of s.12; ii) The right to object under the sub-section can be waived only subsequent to a dispute having arisen between the parties; iii) The waiver must be in the form of an express agreement in writing - The proviso to sub-section (5) of s.12 stipulates that parties, after disputes have arisen, must expressly agree in writing to waive the ineligibility of the proposed arbitrator - This impliedly means that the parties are waiving their right to object to the arbitrator's ineligibility in terms of s.12(5) of the Act, 1996. [Paras 75, 76] Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 - sub-section (5) of s.12 - An express agreement in writing, waiving the bar under sub-section (5) of s.12: Held: It is only through an express agreement in writing, waiving the bar under sub-section (5) of s.12, that the other party can be said to have voluntarily consented to the unilateral appointment of such an arbitrator - The proviso conveys that the arbitrator, although ineligible to be appointed, yet can continue to perform his functions, as it is oriented towards facilitating party autonomy - Thus, the proviso reinforces party autonomy and equal treatment of parties in arbitration - In other words, even though the appointment had been made by one of the parties, by the act of entering into an agreement in writing, the other party expresses its consent - The manner of the agreement prescribed by the statute demonstrates voluntariness by the parties - The ineligibility of an arbitrator can be waived only by an express agreement in writing - In the present case, there is no agreement in writing, after the disputes arose, waiving the ineligibility of the sole arbitrator or the right to object u/s.12(5) of the Act, 1996. [Paras 81, 82, 89] 34 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 - sub-section (5) of s.12, s.21, s.33 - What cannot be countenanced to mean \"an express agreement in writing\" within the meaning of the proviso to sub-section (5) of s.12 of the Act, 1996: Held: A notice invoking the arbitration clause u/s.21 of the Act, 1996, a procedural order, submission of statement of claim by the appellants, the filing an application seeking interim relief, or a reply to an application u/s.33 of the Act, 1996, cannot be countenanced to mean \"an express agreement in writing\" within the meaning of the proviso to sub-section (5) of s.12 of the Act, 1996. [Para 96] Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 - s.12(5), s.14 - Where a party is aggrieved by the ineligibility of an arbitrator: Held: Where a party is aggrieved by the ineligibility of an arbitrator u/s.12(5), it may directly approach the court u/s.14 of the Act, 1996 - There is no doubt that when an arbitrator is ineligible u/s. 12(5), i.e., he lacks inherent jurisdiction to hold the position, his mandate stands automatically terminated, and it is not necessary for the parties to challenge his appointment u/s.12 r/w. s.13 - When such a challenge is made, the court is required to determine whether the arbitrator suffers from de jure inability u/s.14(1)(a) of the Act, 1996. [Para 102] Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 - s.14 and s.15(2) - Terminating mandate of arbitrator and substituting arbitrator: Held: An application u/s. 14 is made for the purpose of terminating the mandate of the arbitrator, and, consequently, a substitute arbitrator is appointed in terms of s.15(2) - As regards where the mandate of the arbitrator has been terminated with the consent of both the parties u/s. 15(1)(b), it is not required for the parties to approach the court to seek termination of the mandate of the arbitrator, because it has been terminated by the parties themselves - The substitution of the arbitrator is sought because the termination of mandate of the arbitrator does not result in the termination of arbitral proceedings - The proceedings remain intact, only the composition of the arbitral tribunal changes. [Paras 103, 104] Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 - s.34 - Challenge to the ineligibility of the arbitrator after arbitral award has been passed: [2026] 1 S.C.R. 35 Bhadra International (India) Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. v. Airports Authority of India Held: When an award has been passed, the proceedings before the arbitral tribunal conclude, leaving no possibility of substituting the arbitrator at this stage - In other words, once an award is passed, the mandate of the arbitral tribunal also arrives at a conclusion - In such circumstances, a party aggrieved by the arbitrator's ineligibility may challenge the award by filing an application u/s.34 of the 1996 Act, as an award passed by an ineligible arbitrator is nullity, non-est, or void ab initio, and against the public policy of India. [Para 109] Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 - Challenge to the ineligibility of the arbitrator at any stage of the proceedings: Held: A challenge to an arbitrator's ineligibility could be raised at any stage because an award passed in such circumstance is non- est, i.e., it carries no enforceability or recognition in law. [Para 113] Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 - s.12(5) - Obligation upon the arbitrator: Held: An arbitrator is better equipped with the position of law on appointments, more particularly, unilateral appointments - Therefore, it becomes incumbent upon the arbitrator that upon entering reference and at the very first hearing, to ensure from the parties that they are willing to participate in the proceedings and to insist upon a written agreement waiving the requirement of s.12(5) of the Act, 1996. [Para 121] Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 - When party does not appear despite receipt of notice: Held: If any party does not appear despite receipt of notice, the arbitrator shall not proceed further and shall immediately withdraw from the arbitral proceedings - The arbitrator must, along with the waiver agreement, record the minutes even when the parties are cooperating - This would certainly save time and avoid multiplicity of proceedings.

Leave granted. 2. Since the issues raised in both the captioned appeals are the same, the parties are same, and the challenge is also to the self-same judgment and order passed by the High Court, those were taken up for hearing analogously and are being disposed of by this common judgment and order. 3. These appeals arise from the common judgment and order dated 11.02.2025 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court of Delhi in FAO(OS) (COMM) Nos. 23 and 24 of 2025 respectively (hereinafter, the \"Impugned Judgment\"), by which the appeals filed by the appellants herein under Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (for short, the \"Act, 1996\") came to be dismissed thereby affirming the order dated 19.02.2022 passed by a learned Single Judge of the High Court in OMP (COMM) Nos. 414 and 415 of 2018 respectively under Section 34 of the Act, 1996 (hereinafter, the \"Single Judge\") dismissing the preliminary objection raised by the appellants as regards unilateral appointment of a sole arbitrator by the respondent. I. FACTUAL MATRIX 4. The facts giving rise to the appeals may be summarized as under:- i. The appellant no. 1 and appellant no. 2, viz. Bhadra International (India) Pvt. Ltd., and Novia International Consulting Aps, respectively executed an agreement to form a joint consortium namely Bhadra International (India) Pvt. Ltd. and Novia International Consulting Aps, for the purposes of undertaking ground handling services at various airports in India. The consortium is the appellant no. 3 before us. ii. The respondent (Airports Authority of India) floated two tender notices inviting tenders for appointment of an agency for ground handling services at some airports. In response to these notices, the appellant no. 3 emerged as the successful bidder. Pursuant to the two notices, the parties executed two License Agreement dated 29.11.2010 (\"License Agreement\"). As per the License Agreement, the appellant no. 3 was permitted to provide ground handling services at the specified airports.\n\n40 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports iii. The aforesaid License Agreement, more particularly, Clause 78 provided that in the event of any dispute or difference arising out of the said license agreement the same would have to be resolved through arbitration. The said clause read as under:- \"78. All disputes and differences, arising out of or, in any way, touching or concerning this Agreement, (except those the decision whereof is otherwise hereinbefore expressly provided for or to which the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1971 and the rules framed hereunder which are now in force or which may hereafter come in to force, are applicable) shall be referred to the sole arbitration of a person, to be appointed by the Chairman of the Authority or, in case the designation of Chairman is changed or his office is abolished, by the person, for the time being entrusted, whether or not, in addition to other functions, with the functions of the Chairman, Airports Authority of India, by whatever designation such person may be called, and, if the Arbitrator, so appointed, is unable or unwilling to act, to the sole arbitrations or some other person to be similarly appointed. It will be no objection to such appointment that the Arbitrator so appointment is a servant of the Authority, that he had to deal with the matters to which this Agreement relates and that in the course of his duties, as such servant of the Authority, he had expressed views on all or any of the matters in dispute or differences. The award of the arbitrator, so appointment, shall be final and binding on the Parties. The Arbitrator may, with the consent of the parties, enlarge, from time to time, the time for making and publishing the award. The venue of the arbitration shall be at New Delhi.\" (Emphasis is ours) iv. On 23.10.2015, the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015 came into effect (for short, \"the Amendment Act, 2015\"), by which sub-section (5) was inserted into Section 12. The provision reads thus:- [2026] 1 S.C.R. 41 Bhadra International (India) Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. v. Airports Authority of India \"[(5) Notwithstanding any prior agreement to the contrary, any person whose relationship, with the parties or counsel or the subject-matter of the dispute, falls under any of the categories specified in the Seventh Schedule shall be ineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator: Provided that parties may, subsequent to disputes having arisen between them, waive the applicability of this sub-section by an express agreement in writing.]\" v. Sometime, in the year 2015, various disputes cropped up between the appellants and the respondent herein. Accordingly, the appellants vide notice dated 27.11.2015 invoked the arbitration clause and requested the respondent to appoint an arbitrator in terms of Clause 78 of the aforesaid License Agreement. The relevant part of the notice reads thus:- \"We also like to bring out most humbly that it is incumbent upon the Chairman AAI to appoint the Sole Arbitrator within a reasonable time, least we might not be left with no recourse, but to seek a relief under Section 11, Sub Section 6, Chapter III of the Arbitration & Reconciliation Act 1996.\" vi. On 22.03.2016, the sole arbitrator passed the first procedural order recording that none of the parties had any objection to his appointment. The procedural order reads thus:- \"PROCEDURAL ORDER NO. 1 With Minutes of, and the Directions made at, the hearing on 22.03.2016 at 1:00 pm [AT D-247 (Basement), Defence Colony, New Delhi-110024] This preliminary meeting of the Tribunal was held D-247 (Basement), Defence Colony, New Delhi-110024 on 22nd March, 2016 at 1:00 PM. None of the parties have any objection to my appointment as the Sole Arbitrator. I declare that I have no interest\n\n42 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports in any of the Parties, or in the disputes referred to the Sole Arbitrator.[…]\" (Emphasis supplied) vii. At the joint request of the parties, two applications were filed under Section 29A of the Act, 1966, seeking extension of time for the completion of the proceedings. On both the occasions, the applications were allowed by the High Court. viii. Ultimately, the sole arbitrator passed the arbitral awards dated 30.07.2018 whereby the claims and counter-claims of the respective parties were rejected. In effect, the arbitrator passed a 'Nil' award. ix. Aggrieved by the dismissal of its claim, the appellants challenged the award by filing applications under Section 34 of the Act, 1996, bearing O.M.P. (COMM) Nos. 414 and 415 of 2018 respectively, before the Single Judge of the High Court. x. Thereafter, by way of applications bearing I.A. Nos. 1834 and 1842 of 2022 respectively, the appellants sought to amend the aforesaid applications to contend that since the arbitrator was appointed unilaterally, the award was liable to be set aside (\"Amendment Application\"). xi. The aforesaid applications filed by the appellants came to be rejected by the Single Judge vide order dated 24.12.2024. xii. Being aggrieved by the aforesaid, the appellants preferred appeals under Section 37 of the Act, 1996, bearing FAO(OS) (COMM) Nos. 23 and 24 of 2025 respectively, seeking to challenge the judgment and order passed by a learned Single Judge. The said appeals came to be dismissed vide the impugned judgment. xiii. In such circumstances referred to above, the appellants are here before this Court with the present appeals. II. JUDGMENT OF THE SINGLE JUDGE ON APPLICATION UNDER SECTION 34 OF THE ACT, 1996 5. Aggrieved by the awards passed by the sole arbitrator, the appellants filed applications under Section 34 of the Act, 1996, raising the [2026] 1 S.C.R. 43 Bhadra International (India) Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. v. Airports Authority of India preliminary objection that since the appointment of the sole arbitrator was made unilaterally by the respondent, the award was liable to be set aside. 6. The learned Single Judge held that the appointment of the arbitrator was in accordance with the procedure agreed upon by the parties under Clause 78 of the License Agreement. Consequently, it rejected the challenge to the appointment of the sole arbitrator on the following grounds:- i. First, it observed that the sole arbitrator appointed by the respondent did not suffer from any disqualification under the Fifth or Seventh Schedule read with Section 12(5) of the Act, 1996. The parties themselves had agreed to the procedure of appointment. Moreover, the appellants did not raise any objection regarding the independence and impartiality of the arbitrator. Accordingly, the appointment of the arbitrator could not have been belatedly called into question. ii. Secondly, on the issue of waiver, the learned Single Judge observed that the proviso to Section 12(5) of the Act, 1996, stipulates the requirement of clear and positive manifestation of waiver in writing. It observed that mere participation in the arbitral proceedings without raising any objection would not constitute an express waiver in writing as per the requirement of the proviso. However, it arrived at the conclusion that the first procedural order passed by the sole arbitrator explicitly recorded that parties had no objection to his appointment. iii. Thus, according to the learned Single Judge, the appellants could be said to have waived the applicability of Section 12(5) by not raising an objection before the sole arbitrator in the first procedural order. III. IMPUGNED JUDGMENT 7. Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the order passed by the learned Single Judge dismissing the preliminary objection in so far as the appointment of the sole arbitrator, the appellants preferred appeals under Section 37 of the Act, 1996. 8. The High Court, in its impugned judgment, held that the appointment of the sole arbitrator was not unilateral, as the respondent had proceeded\n\n44 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports to appoint arbitrator only pursuant to the written request made by the appellants. Therefore, it could not be said that the appellants had not consented to the appointment. The High Court further noted that the sole arbitrator had expressly obtained the consent of the parties, and at no point of time the appellants asserted that their consent was incorrectly recorded or that they had not consented. 9. The High Court observed that the appellants continued to participate in the arbitral proceedings without raising any objection. It also observed that the challenge to the jurisdiction of the arbitrator was not raised in the first instance but rather made belatedly through the Amendment Application. 10. The appellants had argued before the High Court that prior to the insertion of sub-section (5) they had no occasion to challenge the appointment of the sole arbitrator. Such a challenge, according to them, could have been raised only after the introduction of sub- section (5) of Section 12. However, the High Court held that it was immaterial as to when the amendment was introduced. The High Court took the view that, the appellants by their conduct could be said to have submitted to the jurisdiction of the sole arbitrator. 11. In the aforesaid context, the High Court observed the fact that the appellants had called upon the respondent to appoint an arbitrator, the sole arbitrator was accordingly appointed, and having unequivocally consented to the arbitral proceedings had no bearing on the insertion of the provision through an amendment. It was further observed that even after the introduction of sub-section (5), the arbitral proceedings continued for more than two years, still the appellants did not, at any stage, raise an objection. 12. Lastly, the High Court observed that the case of the appellants cannot be equated with cases in which an objection to the appointment of the arbitrator have been raised throughout the proceedings, or at every stage. IV. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS 13. Mr. Navin Pahwa, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellants would argue that the sole arbitrator was ineligible to act as an arbitrator as he was unilaterally appointed by the Chairman of the respondent. Such an appointment was void ab initio and non-est in law, and therefore, the arbitral awards would be a nullity. He relied [2026] 1 S.C.R. 45 Bhadra International (India) Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. v. Airports Authority of India on the decision of this Court in Bharat Broadband Network Ltd. v. United Telecoms Ltd., reported in (2019) 5 SCC 755, to submit that an appointment made by an ineligible person is void ab initio. 14. In the same breath, Mr. Pahwa submitted that since the appointment of the arbitrator was void, the proceedings conducted pursuant to such appointment would also be a nullity. As a result, the awards passed by the sole arbitrator would also be contrary to the public policy of India, and thus, liable to be set aside. 15. He further submitted that where the right to appoint a sole arbitrator rests solely with one party, that party's choice would inevitably carry an element of exclusivity in determining the course of the arbitration. To fortify his submission, he relied on the decision of this Court in TRF Ltd. v. Energo Engineering Projects Ltd., reported in (2017) 8 SCC 377. He submitted that a Managing Director, ineligible to act as an arbitrator under Section 12(5) read with Seventh Schedule of the Act, 1996, could not have appointed an arbitrator or nominate any other person to be an arbitrator. 16. He highlighted that this Court has affirmed the decision in TRF (supra) in Perkins Eastman Architects DPC & Anr. v. HSCC (India) Ltd., reported in (2020) 20 SCC 760. In the present case, the Chairman of the respondent was ineligible to act as an arbitrator by virtue of Items 1, 5, and 12 of the Seventh Schedule respectively. Consequently, any arbitrator appointed by such an ineligible person would be, by operation of law, equally ineligible to act as an arbitrator. 17. It was further submitted that an objection to the unilateral appointment may be raised at any stage, including for the first time in Section 34 proceedings. He added that the appellants by participating in the proceedings did not waive their right to raise an objection in terms of the proviso to Section 12(5) of the Act, 1996. To fortify his submission, he relied on the decision in Lion Engineering Consultants v. State of Madhya Pradesh, reported in (2018) 16 SCC 758, Hindustan Zinc Ltd. v. Ajmer Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd., reported in (2019) 17 SCC 82, Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. v. Narendra Kumar Prajapat, reported in 2023 SCC OnLine Del 3148 respectively. 18. Mr. Pahwa further submitted that the proviso to Section 12(5) makes it limpid that ineligibility of an arbitrator could only be waived by an \"express agreement in writing\" between the parties, and such an agreement must be entered into after disputes have arisen. To 46 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports make good his case, Mr. Pahwa placed reliance on the decisions of this Court in Bharat Broadband (supra) and Central Organization for Railway Electrification v. ECI SPIR SMO MCML (JV) A Joint Venture Company, reported in (2025) 4 SCC 641 (\"CORE II\"). 19. He would submit that the law requires a conscious waiver, reduced into writing and signed by both parties. In this regard, he submitted that mere participation in proceedings, filing of statement of claim, silence, or not objecting to the appointment is insufficient to constitute a waiver. In the present case, the notice of invocation of arbitration, or not objecting in the first procedural order, or participating in the proceedings, or filing application under Sections 17 or 29A respectively would not amount to an \"express agreement in writing\". 20. In such circumstances referred to above, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellants-claimants would submit that there being merit in his appeals, the same may be allowed and the impugned judgment passed by the High Court may be set aside. V. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 21. Mr. Parag Tripathi, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the respondent would submit that no error, not to speak of any error of law, could be said to have been committed by the High Court in passing the impugned judgment. 22. Mr. Tripathi submitted that the limited question that falls for the consideration of this Court is whether the present case falls within the proviso to Section 12(5) of the Act, 1996. In other words, whether there was a waiver by an \"express agreement in writing\". 23. He submitted that the first procedural order recording the consent of the appellants would constitute an \"express agreement in writing\" as per the proviso as it was subsequent to the dispute arising between the parties. Mr. Tripathi emphasized that the provision does not provide a format for an \"express agreement\". He added that in so far as proposal or acceptance of any promise is made in words, the promise is said to be express. To make good this submission, he relied on the decision in the case of Bharat Broadband (supra). 24. It was further submitted that no objection/consent of the appellants recorded in the first procedural order acts as an acknowledgment in writing with respect to the qualifications as well as the appointment [2026] 1 S.C.R. 47 Bhadra International (India) Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. v. Airports Authority of India of the sole arbitrator. The appellants had also filed their statement of claim before the sole arbitrator. This is suggestive of the fact that the appellants in explicit terms had submitted to the jurisdiction of the sole arbitrator, and agreed to get the dispute resolved by the sole arbitrator. 25. Mr. Tripathi relied on McLeod Russel India Ltd. & Ors. v. Aditya Birla Finance Ltd. & Ors., reported in 2023 SCC OnLine Cal 330, and Anuj Kumar v. Franchise India Brands Ltd., reported in 2023 SCC OnLine Del 2560, to submit that the contents of pleadings or communication constitute an express agreement in writing, and the decision in Anuj Kumar (supra) is not in conflict with the decision of this Court in Bharat Broadband (supra). 26. Mr. Tripathi further submitted that although sub-section (5) of Section 12 read with Seventh Schedule of the Act, 1996 was introduced during the pendency of the arbitral proceedings, yet the appellants chose not to raise an objection to the appointment of the sole arbitrator. Accordingly, he submitted that the appellants did not raise any objection as to the constitution, appointment, jurisdiction, independence or impartiality of the sole arbitrator under Sections 13, 14, or 16 of the Act, 1996, respectively throughout the proceedings. 27. He added that the appellants raised the objection to the appointment of the sole arbitration only by way of an amendment to the Section 34 application. The appellants did so as an afterthought, more than three years after filing the said application. 28. In such circumstances referred to above, the learned Senior Counsel prayed that there being no merit in the appeals, the same may be dismissed. VI. ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION 29. Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and having gone through the materials on record, the following questions fall for our consideration:- i. Whether the sole arbitrator could be said to have become \"ineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator\" by virtue of sub- section (5) of Section 12 of the Act, 1996? ii. Whether the parties could be said to have waived the applicability of sub-section (5) of Section 12 of the Act, 1996, by way of their conduct, either expressed or implied?\n\n48 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports iii. Whether the appellants could have raised an objection to the appointment of the sole arbitrator for the first time in an application under Section 34 of the Act, 1996? VII. ANALYSIS i. Whether the sole arbitrator could be said to have become \"ineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator\" by virtue of sub-section (5) of Section 12 of the Act, 1996? 30. It was submitted on behalf of the appellants herein that the sole arbitrator appointed by the Chairman of the respondent was ineligible to act as an arbitrator as he was appointed unilaterally. Further, such an appointment was void ab initio and non-est in law. 31. On the aforesaid issue, the High Court, in its impugned judgment, held that the appointment of the sole arbitrator was not unilateral, as the respondents had proceeded to appoint the arbitrator only pursuant to the written request of the appellants. Therefore, the notice invoking arbitration operated as the appellants' consent to the appointment of the arbitrator. a. Interplay between Equal Treatment of Parties and Party Autonomy 32. In order to address this issue, we shall first look into Section 18 of the Act, 1996. It reads thus:- \"18. Equal treatment of parties.--The parties shall be treated with equality and each party shall be given a full opportunity to present this case.\" 33. Section 18 outlines two principles: first, equal treatment of parties; and secondly, right to a fair hearing. The principle of equal treatment of parties applies not only to the arbitral proceedings, but also to the procedure for appointment of arbitrators. The section casts a responsibility on the arbitrator to act impartially, objectively, and without bias, and also on the parties to adhere to standards of fairness. The principle of 'equal treatment of the parties' means that the parties must have the possibility of participating in the constitution of the arbitral tribunal on equal terms. 34. Equal participation of the parties in the process of appointment of arbitrators entails that the contracting parties have an equal say in the [2026] 1 S.C.R. 49 Bhadra International (India) Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. v. Airports Authority of India constitution of the arbitral tribunal. Such participation eliminates the likelihood of challenges to the arbitrator at a later stage. It is needless to say that independence and impartiality in arbitral proceedings would be served only when the parties participate equally at all stages. 35. It would be apposite to refer to the following observations of P.S. Narasimha, J., in CORE II (supra):- \"Distinct duties of arbitrators and arbitrating parties 231. There are two distinct obligations. The first is the obligation of the parties to the agreement, and the second is the neutrality and objectivity that an arbitrator must maintain. The obligations on the parties to the arbitration agreement to constitute an independent and impartial Arbitral Tribunal is distinct from the objectivity and impartiality that an arbitrator(s) must himself maintain. The foundation of the former is within the statutory framework, coupled with certain public policy considerations. The latter is simply the duty to act judicially, it is not superimposed by any statute or public policy, but arises because of the very nature of the calling i.e. to judge what is right and what is wrong.[…]\" (Emphasis supplied) 36. The principle of equal treatment of parties is not new to the arbitration regime in India. It has long been recognised that equal participation in the constitution of the arbitral tribunal is integral in ensuring impartiality and preserving fairness of the arbitral process. Even prior to the Amendment Act, 2015, this Court in Dharma Prathishthanam v. Madhok Construction (P) Ltd., reported in (2005) 9 SCC 686, held that a unilateral appointment, without the consent of the other party is illegal and alien to law. The relevant observations read thus:- \"12. On a plain reading of the several provisions referred to hereinabove, we are clearly of the opinion that the procedure followed and the methodology adopted by the respondent is wholly unknown to law and the appointment of the sole arbitrator Shri Swami Dayal, the reference of disputes to such arbitrator and the ex parte proceedings and award given by the arbitrator are all void ab initio and\n\n50 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports hence nullity, liable to be ignored. In case of arbitration without the intervention of the court, the parties must rigorously stick to the agreement entered into between the two. If the arbitration clause names an arbitrator as the one already agreed upon, the appointment of an arbitrator poses no difficulty. If the arbitration clause does not name an arbitrator but provides for the manner in which the arbitrator is to be chosen and appointed, then the parties are bound to act accordingly. If the parties do not agree then arises the complication which has to be resolved by reference to the provisions of the Act. One party cannot usurp the jurisdiction of the court and proceed to act unilaterally. A unilateral appointment and a unilateral reference -- both will be illegal. It may make a difference if in respect of a unilateral appointment and reference the other party submits to the jurisdiction of the arbitrator and waives its rights which it has under the agreement, then the arbitrator may proceed with the reference and the party submitting to his jurisdiction and participating in the proceedings before him may later on be precluded and estopped from raising any objection in that regard.[…]\" (Emphasis supplied) 37. What flows from the aforesaid is that the principle of equal treatment of parties which has always formed part of the Act, 1996, has been articulated with greater clarity and precision by the legislature through the Amendment Act, 2015. The Amendment Act, 2015, just crystallizes what was previously implicit. It makes the statutory guarantee of equal treatment in the process of appointment of the arbitrator explicit. 38. One another good reason to hold the aforesaid is that, although Section 11(2) of the Act, 1996, stipulates that the parties are free to agree on a procedure for appointing the arbitrator or arbitrators, yet this freedom is not unbridled. The exercise of party autonomy must operate within the framework of the Act, 1996. In case of conflict, mandatory provisions of the Act, 1996, prevail over the arbitration agreement. 39. The principle of party autonomy does not obliterate the principle of equal treatment of the parties, either in the procedure for appointment [2026] 1 S.C.R. 51 Bhadra International (India) Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. v. Airports Authority of India of arbitrators or in the arbitral proceedings. The exercise of party autonomy has to be in consonance with the principles of equal treatment of parties, which impliedly include the independence and impartiality of arbitrators. b. Scope and Application of sub-section (5) of Section 12 of the Act, 1996 40. The Amendment Act, 2015, was introduced with the objective of ensuring neutrality of an arbitrator when he is approached in connection with a possible appointment. Therefore, with a view to inculcate the principles of independence and impartiality, the Amendment Act, 2015, brought amendments, inter alia, to Section 12 of the Act, 1996. The amended section reads thus:- \"12. Grounds for challenge.--4 [(1) When a person is approached in connection with his possible appointment as an arbitrator, he shall disclose in writing any circumstances,-- (a) such as the existence either direct or indirect, of any past or present relationship with or interest in any of the parties or in relation to the subject-matter in dispute, whether financial, business, professional or other kind, which is likely to give rise to justifiable doubts as to his independence or impartiality; and (b) which are likely to affect his ability to devote sufficient time to the arbitration and in particular his ability to complete the entire arbitration within a period of twelve months. Explanation1.--The grounds stated in the Fifth Schedule shall guide in determining whether circumstances exist which give rise to justifiable doubts as to the independence or impartiality of an arbitrator. Explanation 2.--The disclosure shall be made by such person in the form specified in the Sixth Schedule.] (2) An arbitrator, from the time of his appointment and throughout the arbitral proceedings, shall, without delay, disclose to the parties in writing any circumstances referred to in sub-section (1) unless they have already been informed of them by him.\n\n52 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports (3) An arbitrator may be challenged only if-- (a) circumstances exist that give rise to justifiable doubts as to his independence or impartiality, or (b) he does not possess the qualifications agreed to by the parties. (4) A party may challenge an arbitrator appointed by him, or in whose appointment he has participated, only for reasons of which he becomes aware after the appointment has been made. [(5) Notwithstanding any prior agreement to the contrary, any person whose relationship, with the parties or counsel or the subject-matter of the dispute, falls under any of the categories specified in the Seventh Schedule shall be ineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator: Provided that parties may, subsequent to disputes having arisen between them, waive the applicability of this sub- section by an express agreement in writing.]\" 41. Sub-section (1) of Section 12 stipulates that when a person is approached to be an arbitrator, he must disclose in writing any circumstance which may fall under clauses (a) and (b) of sub- section (1) respectively. Clause (a) relates to circumstances that may give rise to justifiable doubts as to his independence or impartiality. Whereas, clause (b) relates to disclosures about the person's ability to devote sufficient time to the arbitration and to complete the proceedings within the prescribed time period. 42. For disclosure under clause (a), the Fifth Schedule, consisting of 34 items, is of aid. The items enumerated in the Fifth Schedule provides for the circumstances that may give rise to justifiable doubts about an arbitrator's independence or impartiality after appointment. 43. While the information required to be disclosed under clause (b) is personal to the individual and could be disclosed only by him. The disclosure has to be made in the form specified in the Sixth Schedule, and has to be made by all proposed arbitrators. It is noteworthy to mention that sub-section (1) comes into application prior to the appointment of a person as an arbitrator. [2026] 1 S.C.R. 53 Bhadra International (India) Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. v. Airports Authority of India 44. Sub-section (2) of Section 12 states that from the appointment of the arbitrator and throughout the arbitral proceedings, the arbitrator must, without delay, disclose in writing any circumstance referred to in sub-section (1) that arises after his appointment. However, if the arbitrator has already informed the parties of the said circumstance earlier, he is not required to make a disclosure again. 45. Sub-section (3) of Section 12 lays down two grounds for challenge to appointment of an arbitrator: first, if any circumstances exist that give rise to justifiable doubts about an arbitrator's independence or impartiality. Secondly, if the arbitrator does not possess the qualifications agreed to by the parties. Sub-section (4) prescribes a caution. It states that a challenge to the appointment of an arbitrator could be maintained only on the grounds that were not disclosed during or after the appointment. 46. Sub-section (5) of Section 12 states that any person whose relationship with the parties or counsel, or the subject-matter of the dispute, falls under any of the grounds mentioned in the Seventh Schedule would be ineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator. It invalidates any prior agreement to the contrary, i.e., an agreement providing for appointment of an arbitrator who would become ineligible on the application of sub-section (5). The proviso to the sub-section provides that after dispute arises between the parties, they may waive the applicability of this provision by entering into an express agreement in writing. 47. The Seventh Schedule lists 19 items, which also form part of the 34 items of the Fifth Schedule. In other words, the Seventh Schedule is a subset of the Fifth Schedule. It is the duty of an arbitrator to keep in mind the items enlisted in the Fifth Schedule and make a disclosure in accordance with the Sixth Schedule. Out of the said 34 items, the legislature has placed 19 items in the Seventh Schedule which make an arbitrator ineligible for appointment. We clarify with a view to obviate any confusion that the Seventh Schedule applies irrespective of whether the appointment has been made unilaterally. 48. If any entry in the Seventh Schedule is attracted, the consequences under Section 12(5) follow. In such circumstances, the disclosure made by the arbitrator does not save the mandate of the arbitrator, and an agreement referred to in the proviso assumes importance. 54 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports We shall discuss the scope and application of the sub-section (5), as well as its proviso, in more detail in the latter part of this judgment. 49. We may now proceed to address the aforesaid issue. There have been submissions by the parties on the applicability of the Amendment Act, 2015, to the present case as the parties executed the License Agreement in 2010. Section 26 of the Amendment Act, 2015, makes it limpid that the Amendment Act, 2015, would apply to arbitral proceedings commenced on or after 23.10.2015. It is a well settled position of law that in the absence of any contrary stipulation in the agreement, arbitral proceedings commence when a notice invoking arbitration is received by the respondent. [See: Board of Control for Cricket in India v. Kochi Cricket Pvt. Ltd. & Ors., (2018) 6 SCC 287] 50. In the present case, the parties have not agreed to a different commencement date. As a sequitur, the date of commencement of the arbitral proceedings was 27.11.2015, i.e., when the notice invoking arbitration was received by the respondent. Thus, the Amendment Act, 2015, more particularly, sub-section (5) of Section 12 of the Act, 1996, would apply to the matter at hand. c. Appointment of the sole arbitrator in light of sub-section (5) of Section 12 of the Act, 1996 51. There is a conspectus of decisions of this Court which lay down that, Section 12 was amended with the objective of ensuring independence and impartiality of arbitrators. By virtue of sub- section (5) of Section 12, any person whose relationship with the parties or counsel, or the dispute, whether direct or indirect, falls within any of the categories specified in the Seventh Schedule is rendered ineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator. We need not discuss all the decisions, but rather intend to refer and rely upon only a few of them. 52. In TRF (supra), the arbitration agreement stated that any dispute or difference between the parties in connection with the agreement shall be referred to the sole arbitration of the Managing Director or his nominee. The issue before this Court was whether the Managing Director, after becoming ineligible by operation of law, is still eligible to nominate an arbitrator.\n\n[2026] 1 S.C.R. 55 Bhadra International (India) Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. v. Airports Authority of India In this context, a three Judge Bench of this Court categorically held that if any person falls under any of the categories mentioned in the Seventh Schedule, he would be ineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator. In the facts of the case, it was held that the Managing Director, by virtue of sub-section (5) of Section 12, acquired the disqualification under the Seventh Schedule. Thus, as he became ineligible by operation of law to act as an arbitrator, he could not have nominated another person as an arbitrator. The relevant observations read thus:- \"54. In such a context, the fulcrum of the controversy would be, can an ineligible arbitrator, like the Managing Director, nominate an arbitrator, who may be otherwise eligible and a respectable person. As stated earlier, we are neither concerned with the objectivity nor the individual respectability. We are only concerned with the authority or the power of the Managing Director. By our analysis, we are obligated to arrive at the conclusion that once the arbitrator has become ineligible by operation of law, he cannot nominate another as an arbitrator. The arbitrator becomes ineligible as per prescription contained in Section 12(5) of the Act. It is inconceivable in law that person who is statutorily ineligible can nominate a person. Needless to say, once the infrastructure collapses, the superstructure is bound to collapse. One cannot have a building without the plinth. Or to put it differently, once the identity of the Managing Director as the sole arbitrator is lost, the power to nominate someone else as an arbitrator is obliterated. Therefore, the view expressed by the High Court is not sustainable and we say so.\" (Emphasis supplied) 53. In a similar fact situation wherein the arbitration agreement empowered the Chairman and Managing Director of the respondent to appoint a sole arbitrator, the issue before this Court in Bharat Broadband (supra) was whether the CMD, after becoming ineligible by operation of law, is still eligible to appoint an arbitrator. The Court held that where a person falls within any of the categories set out in the Seventh Schedule, which could be by virtue of a 56 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports relationship with the parties, or their counsel, or the subject-matter of the dispute, such a person becomes ineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator. The ineligibility could be removed after dispute has arisen, and only if the parties waive the applicability of the provision by an \"express agreement in writing\". The arbitrator becomes de jure unable to perform his function as he falls within the categories mentioned in the Seventh Schedule. The relevant observations read thus:- \"15. Section 12(5), on the other hand, is a new provision which relates to the de jure inability of an arbitrator to act as such. Under this provision, any prior agreement to the contrary is wiped out by the non obstante clause in Section 12(5) the moment any person whose relationship with the parties or the counsel or the subject-matter of the dispute falls under the Seventh Schedule. The sub- section then declares that such person shall be \"ineligible\" to be appointed as arbitrator. The only way in which this ineligibility can be removed is by the proviso, which again is a special provision which states that parties may, subsequent to disputes having arisen between them, waive the applicability of Section 12(5) by an express agreement in writing. What is clear, therefore, is that where, under any agreement between the parties, a person falls within any of the categories set out in the Seventh Schedule, he is, as a matter of law, ineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator. The only way in which this ineligibility can be removed, again, in law, is that parties may after disputes have arisen between them, waive the applicability of this sub-section by an \"express agreement in writing\". Obviously, the \"express agreement in writing\" has reference to a person who is interdicted by the Seventh Schedule, but who is stated by parties (after the disputes have arisen between them) to be a person in whom they have faith notwithstanding the fact that such person is interdicted by the Seventh Schedule.\" (Emphasis supplied) 54. We may also look into the decision of this Court in Perkins Eastman (supra), where the arbitration clause empowered the Chairman and Managing Director of the respondent to appoint a sole arbitrator. [2026] 1 S.C.R. 57 Bhadra International (India) Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. v. Airports Authority of India Following TRF (supra), this Court held that the Managing Director was incompetent to appoint the sole arbitrator because he would be deemed to have an interest in the outcome of the dispute. Since, the ineligibility stems from the operation of law, not only is a person having an interest in the dispute or its outcome ineligible to act as an arbitrator, but appointment by such a person would be ex facie invalid. The relevant observations read thus:- \"20. We thus have two categories of cases. The first, similar to the one dealt with in TRF Ltd. [TRF Ltd. v. Energo Engg. Projects Ltd., (2017) 8 SCC 377 : (2017) 4 SCC (Civ) 72] where the Managing Director himself is named as an arbitrator with an additional power to appoint any other person as an arbitrator. In the second category, the Managing Director is not to act as an arbitrator himself but is empowered or authorised to appoint any other person of his choice or discretion as an arbitrator. If, in the first category of cases, the Managing Director was found incompetent, it was because of the interest that he would be said to be having in the outcome or result of the dispute. The element of invalidity would thus be directly relatable to and arise from the interest that he would be having in such outcome or decision. If that be the test, similar invalidity would always arise and spring even in the second category of cases. If the interest that he has in the outcome of the dispute, is taken to be the basis for the possibility of bias, it will always be present irrespective of whether the matter stands under the first or second category of cases. We are conscious that if such deduction is drawn from the decision of this Court in TRF Ltd. [TRF Ltd. v. Energo Engg. Projects Ltd., (2017) 8 SCC 377 : (2017) 4 SCC (Civ) 72] , all cases having clauses similar to that with which we are presently concerned, a party to the agreement would be disentitled to make any appointment of an arbitrator on its own and it would always be available to argue that a party or an official or an authority having interest in the dispute would be disentitled to make appointment of an arbitrator. 21. But, in our view that has to be the logical deduction from TRF Ltd. [TRF Ltd. v. Energo Engg. Projects Ltd., 58 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports (2017) 8 SCC 377 : (2017) 4 SCC (Civ) 72] Para 50 of the decision shows that this Court was concerned with the issue, \"whether the Managing Director, after becoming ineligible by operation of law, is he still eligible to nominate an arbitrator\" The ineligibility referred to therein, was as a result of operation of law, in that a person having an interest in the dispute or in the outcome or decision thereof, must not only be ineligible to act as an arbitrator but must also not be eligible to appoint anyone else as an arbitrator and that such person cannot and should not have any role in charting out any course to the dispute resolution by having the power to appoint an arbitrator. The next sentences in the paragraph, further show that cases where both the parties could nominate respective arbitrators of their choice were found to be completely a different situation. The reason is clear that whatever advantage a party may derive by nominating an arbitrator of its choice would get counter-balanced by equal power with the other party. But, in a case where only one party has a right to appoint a sole arbitrator, its choice will always have an element of exclusivity in determining or charting the course for dispute resolution. Naturally, the person who has an interest in the outcome or decision of the dispute must not have the power to appoint a sole arbitrator. That has to be taken as the essence of the amendments brought in by the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015 (3 of 2016) and recognised by the decision of this Court in TRF Ltd. [TRF Ltd. v. Energo Engg. Projects Ltd., (2017) 8 SCC 377 : (2017) 4 SCC (Civ) 72]\" (Emphasis supplied) 55. The Bombay High Court, in Lite Bite Foods Pvt. Ltd. v. AAI, reported in 2019 SCC OnLine Bom 5163, dealt with a submission similar to the one arising from Clause 75 of the License Agreement before us. It was contended that only when an employee of the respondent is the named arbitrator does such person become ineligible to act, and equally ineligible to nominate another arbitrator. The Court held that the embargo under sub-section (5) of Section 12 is against granting any single party a unilateral or one-sided authority\n\n[2026] 1 S.C.R. 59 Bhadra International (India) Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. v. Airports Authority of India in constituting the arbitral tribunal. We are in complete agreement with the observations of G. S. Patel, J., that, \"The guiding principle is neutrality, independence, fairness and transparency even in the arbitral-forum selection process\". The relevant observations read thus:- \"23. The present case may not be within the confines of TRF Ltd., i.e. the tender approving authority is not both arbitrator and, if disqualified, the sole repository of arbitrator-appointing power. He is only the latter. But that now matters at all. Perkins Eastman clearly holds the field and it covers a situation precisely such as the present one where AAI -- and only AAI -- has the exclusive right of appointed (not merely nominating) an arbitrator. The question is not, as Ms. Munim would have it, the perceived bias or impartiality of the arbitrator. He may well be an unknown entity. The question is of one-sidedness in the arbitral tribunal appointment procedure itself. This is the destination to which Perkins Eastman takes us for it requires that there be neutrality in the dispute resolution process throughout. If I might be permitted a license, in my reading of it, what Perkins Eastman says is this : that you cannot have an impartial arbitration free from all justifiable doubt if the manner in which the arbitral tribunal is constituted itself is beset by justifiable doubt.\" xxx 25. Ms. Munim's last submission is that the only prohibition is against a named person being the arbitrator or empowered to appoint an arbitrator. This is clearly incorrect. The interdiction runs against any one party being given unilateral or one-sided power in the matter of constitution of the arbitral tribunal.\" (Emphasis supplied) 56. The phrase \"operation of law\" mentioned in the aforesaid decisions covers the Act, 1996, as well as the Constitution of India and any other Central of State law. In Lombardi Engg. Ltd. v. Uttarakhand Jal Vidyut Nigam Ltd., reported in (2024) 4 SCC 341, where one of us, J.B. Pardiwala, J., speaking for the Bench held that an arbitration agreement has to comply with the requirements of (i) Section 7 of 60 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports the Act, 1996; (ii) any other provisions of the Act, 1996, and Central/ State law; (iii) Constitution of India. We may refer to the following observations for the benefit of exposition:- \"79.5. In State of A.P. v. P. Laxmi Devi [State of A.P. v. P. Laxmi Devi, (2008) 4 SCC 720] , this Court observed : (SCC p. 737, paras 33-34) \"33. According to Kelson, in every country there is a hierarchy of legal norms, headed by what he calls as the \"grundnorm\". If a legal norm in a higher layer of this hierarchy conflicts with a legal norm in a lower layer the former will prevail… 34. In India the grundnorm is the Indian Constitution,…\" 80. Thus, in the context of the arbitration agreement, the layers of the Grundnorm as per Kelsen's theory would be in the following hierarchy: (i) Constitution of India, 1950; (ii) Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 & any other Central/State law; (iii) Arbitration agreement entered into by the parties in light of Section 7 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. 81. Thus, the arbitration agreement, has to comply with the requirements of the following and cannot fall foul of: (i) Section 7 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act; (ii) any other provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 & Central/State Law; (iii) Constitution of India, 1950.\" (Emphasis supplied) 57. When an arbitration agreement is in violation of sub-section (5) of Section 12 of the Act, 1996, the parties can neither insist on appointment of an arbitrator in terms of the agreement nor would any appointment so made be valid in the eyes of law. 58. Unilateral appointments are not consistent with the basic tenet of arbitration, i.e., mutual confidence in the arbitrator. It would not be\n\n[2026] 1 S.C.R. 61 Bhadra International (India) Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. v. Airports Authority of India unreasonable for a party to apprehend that an arbitrator unilaterally appointed by the opposite party may not act with complete impartiality. 59. The test to determine bias is not actual proof of bias but reasonable apprehension of bias. The moment this apprehension takes birth in the mind of a party, the trust in the arbitral proceedings dies. A Constitution Bench of this Court in CORE II (supra), wherein one of us, J. B. Pardiwala, J., was a part of the Bench, laid down the test for real likelihood of bias. It reads thus:- \"(b) Real likelihood of bias 92. The nemo judex rule may be applicable where a Judge's conduct or circumstances give rise to an apprehension of bias. In such situations, the Judge does not have a financial or cause-based interest in the outcome of the dispute but provides benefit to a party by failing to be neutral and impartial. The determination of bias does not depend upon actual proof of bias but whether there is a real possibility of bias based on the facts and circumstances. xxx (iv) Indian approach to the bias test 103. This Court has consistently adopted the real likelihood test to determine bias. [Rattan Lal Sharma v. Hari Ram (Co-Education) Higher Secondary School, (1993) 4 SCC 10, para 11 : 1993 SCC (L&S) 1106] In Manak Lal v. Prem Chand Singhvi [Manak Lal v. Prem Chand Singhvi, 1957 SCC OnLine SC 10, para 4] , P.B. Gajendragadkar, J. (as the learned Chief Justice then was) observed that the test to determine bias is whether a litigant could reasonably apprehend that a bias attributable to a member of the tribunal might have operated against him in the final decision. In S. Parthasarathi v. State of A.P. [S. Parthasarathi v. State of A.P., (1974) 3 SCC 459, para 14 : 1973 SCC (Cri) 580 : 1973 SCC (L&S) 580] , K.K. Mathew, J. observed that the test of likelihood of bias is based on the reasonable apprehension of a reasonable man fully cognizant of the facts. The learned Judge further observed that the question of whether the real likelihood 62 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports of bias exists is to be determined on the probabilities to be inferred from the objective circumstances by a court or based on impressions that might reasonably be left on the minds of the aggrieved party or the public at large. [S. Parthasarathi, (1974) 3 SCC 459, p. 465, para 16. It was observed:\"16. The tests of \"real likelihood\" and \"reasonable suspicion\" are really inconsistent with each other. We think that the reviewing authority must make a determination on the basis of the whole evidence before it, whether a reasonable man would in the circumstances infer that there is real likelihood of bias.[…].\" (Emphasis supplied) 60. It is apposite to understand that Section 12(5) does not prohibit unilateral appointment of an arbitrator. It provides that whenever an appointment of an arbitrator is hit by the bar under Section 12(5), the arbitrator would be ineligible to act, irrespective of whether the appointment was unilateral or with consent of both parties. In such circumstances, the parties may, in the manner provided under the proviso, waive the ineligibility. We shall discuss the scope and application of the proviso in more detail in the latter part of this judgment. d. De Jure inability of the arbitrator to perform his functions 61. In the aforesaid context, it would be apposite to briefly explain what constitutes as de jure ineligibility under Section 12(5). The expression de jure denotes a condition rooted in strict compliance with the requirements of law. De jure inability refers to a situation in which an arbitrator is legally incapable of performing his functions and is, by operation of law, barred from continuing in office. Such inability strikes at the very root of the arbitrator's authority to act, thereby affecting his inherent capacity to discharge his functions as an arbitrator. It is this legal incapacity, arising from statutory disqualifications, that results in the termination of the \"mandate of an arbitrator\" under Section 14(1)(a) of the Act, 1996. 62. De jure inability referred to under Section 14(1)(a) may arise from the provisions of the Act, 1996, or from any other existing law that renders an arbitrator legally incapable of performing his functions. As regards de jure ineligibility, it flows from sub-section (5) of Section 12 [2026] 1 S.C.R. 63 Bhadra International (India) Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. v. Airports Authority of India read with the Seventh Schedule, which disqualifies certain persons from being appointed or continuing as arbitrators. 63. In other words, the ineligibility under Section 12(5) precedes de jure inability under Section 14(1)(a). In other words, de jure ineligibility is the specie and de jure inability is the genus. To put this in context, de jure inability is determined when an aggrieved party is able to indicate that the circumstances under the Seventh Schedule have been met. 64. It would be worthwhile to refer to the observations made by this Court in HRD Corpn v. GAIL (India) Ltd., reported in (2018) 12 SCC 471. It was observed thus:- \"12. After the 2016 Amendment Act, a dichotomy is made by the Act between persons who become \"ineligible\" to be appointed as arbitrators, and persons about whom justifiable doubts exist as to their independence or impartiality. Since ineligibility goes to the root of the appointment, Section 12(5) read with the Seventh Schedule makes it clear that if the arbitrator falls in any one of the categories specified in the Seventh Schedule, he becomes \"ineligible\" to act as arbitrator. Once he becomes ineligible, it is clear that, under Section 14(1)(a), he then becomes de jure unable to perform his functions inasmuch as, in law, he is regarded as \"ineligible\".[…]\" (Emphasis supplied) 65. The Madras High Court in Clarke Energy India Pvt. Ltd. v. SAS EPC Solution Pvt. Ltd. & Anr., reported in 2021 SCC OnLine Mad 6121, observed thus:- \"22. Turning to de jure inability to perform functions, it should be noted at the threshold that the expression is not defined in the Arbitration Act. The word 'de jure' in Latin means \"as a matter of law\". It has been defined in Black's Law Dictionary, 11 Edition (2019), as \"existing by right or according to law\". Thus, it appears that the expression de jure applies undoubtedly to legal disability. One illustration of legal disability would be if the arbitrator is ineligible in terms of the Seventh Schedule. This was expressly dealt with by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in HRD Corporation as\n\n64 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports well as Bharat Broadband.[…] However, ineligibility is only one illustration of de jure inability to function. It is conceivable that an arbitrator may be afflicted by some form of cognitive impairment. If such cognitive impairment is serious enough to lead to an inference that such arbitrator is not of sound mind, whether on account of schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease or the like, as understood in the Indian Contract Act, 1872, it would result in de jure inability to function even if the arbitrator concerned declines to withdraw. Less serious forms of cognitive impairment, such as bipolar disorder and the like, may, on the other hand, may pose greater challenges. Besides, an arbitrator may be adjudged insolvent after entering upon reference. By relying upon the applicable insolvency statute, it could be contended with a fair measure of justification that he is de jure unable to function.\" (Emphasis supplied) 66. It would be apposite to refer to the relevant Items under the head \"Arbitrator's relationship with the parties or counsel\" in the Seventh Schedule of the Act, 1996, for the purpose of matter at hand. It reads thus:- \"THE SEVENTH SCHEDULE [See section 12(5)] Arbitrator's relationship with the parties or counsel 1. The arbitrator is an employee, consultant, advisor or has any other past or present business relationship with a party. 2. The arbitrator currently represents or advises one of the parties or an affiliate of one of the parties. xxx 5. The arbitrator is a manager, director or part of the management, or has a similar controlling influence, in an affiliate of one of the parties if the affiliate is directly involved in the matters in dispute in the arbitration. xxx [2026] 1 S.C.R. 65 Bhadra International (India) Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. v. Airports Authority of India 12. The arbitrator is a manager, director or part of the management, or has a similar controlling influence in one of the parties. 13. The arbitrator has a significant financial interest in one of the parties or the outcome of the case. […]\" 67. From the above exposition of law, the Chairman of the respondent was wholly ineligible to appoint an arbitrator. The Items 1, 2, 5, 12, and 13 of the Seventh Schedule respectively, clearly attach to the Chairman of the respondent. Once the Chairman is rendered ineligible by operation of law, he cannot nominate or appoint another person as an arbitrator. To illustrate, one who cannot sit on a chair himself cannot authorise another to sit on it either. 68. We are in complete agreement that the present case is squarely covered by the decisions of this Court in Perkins Eastman (supra) and Bharat Broadband (supra) respectively. The unilateral appointment of a sole arbitrator is void ab initio, and the sole arbitrator so appointed is de jure ineligible to act as an arbitrator in terms of Section 12(5) read with the Seventh Schedule of the Act, 1996. 69. Thus, we have no hesitation in saying that its High Court, in the impugned judgment, committed an error in holding that the appointment was not unilateral merely because the respondent proceeded to appoint the sole arbitrator pursuant to notice invoking arbitration. 70. We would like to clarify that a notice under Section 21 of the Act, 1996, is an expression to set the arbitration agreement into motion upon arising of disputes between the parties. The section states that the date of commencement of arbitration would be the date on which the recipient receives the notice from the claimant that the dispute be referred to arbitration. The notice acts as a communication that the sender is aggrieved and seeks to invoke the arbitration agreement. It does not, by itself, operate as consent to any appointment to be made in the future. ii. Whether the parties could be said to have waived the applicability of sub-section (5) of Section 12 of the Act, 1996, by way of their conduct, either expressed or implied? 71. It was submitted on behalf of the appellants herein that the appellants never waived their right to object in terms of the proviso to Section\n\n66 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports 12(5) of the Act, 1996. The proviso to Section 12(5) requires that the ineligibility of an arbitrator could only be waived by an \"express agreement in writing\" between the parties, and such agreement must be entered into after the dispute has arisen. It was further canvassed by the appellants that no agreement was executed, signed, or even contemplated by the parties to this effect after the dispute arose. 72. In this regard, the respondent vociferously submitted that the present case falls within the proviso to Section 12(5). To indicate the same, instances like recording of \"no objection\" in the first procedural order, submission of statement of claim, the joint request to extend the mandate under Section 29A, and continued participation in the proceedings, were highlighted to submit that the appellants had waived their right to object. The procedural order constitutes an \"express agreement in writing\" and satisfies the requirement under the proviso to Section 12(5) of the Act, 1996. At the cost of repetition, the procedural order reads thus:- \"PROCEDURAL ORDER NO. 1 With Minutes of, and the Directions made at, the hearing on 22.03.2016 at 1:00 pm [AT D-247 (Basement), Defence Colony, New Delhi-110024] This preliminary meeting of the Tribunal was held D-247 (Basement), Defence Colony, New Delhi-110024 on 22nd March, 2016 at 1:00 PM. None of the parties have any objection to my appointment as the Sole Arbitrator. I declare that I have no interest in any of the Parties, or in the disputes referred to the Sole Arbitrator.[…]\" (Emphasis supplied) 73. On the aforesaid issue, the High Court, in its impugned judgment, observed that the sole arbitrator obtained the consent of the parties for the purpose of continuing to arbitrate in the form of the procedural order. What weighed with the High Court was that the appellants participated in the proceedings, which continued for over two years, and did not they invoke Section 12(5), or object against the jurisdiction of the arbitrator at any stage. [2026] 1 S.C.R. 67 Bhadra International (India) Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. v. Airports Authority of India a. Meaning and Import of the expression \"express agreement in writing\" used in proviso to sub-section (5) of Section 12 of the Act, 1996 74. Sub-section (5) of Section 12 of the Act, 1996, reads thus:- \"[(5) Notwithstanding any prior agreement to the contrary, any person whose relationship, with the parties or counsel or the subject-matter of the dispute, falls under any of the categories specified in the Seventh Schedule shall be ineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator: Provided that parties may, subsequent to disputes having arisen between them, waive the applicability of this sub- section by an express agreement in writing.]\" 75. The essentials of the proviso to Section 12(5) are:- i. The parties can waive their right to object under sub-section (5) of Section 12; ii. The right to object under the sub-section can be waived only subsequent to a dispute having arisen between the parties; iii. The waiver must be in the form of an express agreement in writing. 76. The proviso to sub-section (5) of Section 12 stipulates that parties, after disputes have arisen, must expressly agree in writing to waive the ineligibility of the proposed arbitrator. This impliedly means that the parties are waiving their right to object to the arbitrator's ineligibility in terms of Section 12(5) of the Act, 1996. 77. Waiver means the intentional giving up of a right. It involves a conscious decision to abandon an existing legal right, benefit, claim, or privilege that a party would otherwise have been entitled to. It amounts to an agreement not to enforce that right. A waiver can occur only when the person making it is fully aware of the right in question and, with complete knowledge, chooses to give it up. [See: State of Punjab v. Davinder Pal Singh Bhullar, (2011) 14 SCC 770] 78. What flows from the aforesaid is when a right exists, i.e., the right to object to the appointment of an ineligible arbitrator in terms of Section 12(5), such a right cannot be taken away by mere implication. For a party to be deprived of this right by way of waiver, there must be\n\n68 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports a conscious and unequivocal expression of intent to relinquish it. Needless to say, for a waiver to be valid, it is necessary that the actor demonstrates the intention to act, and for an act to be intentional, the actor must understand the act and its consequences. 79. The expression \"express agreement in writing\" demonstrates a deliberate and informed act that although a party is fully aware of the arbitrator's ineligibility, yet it chooses to forego the right to object against the appointment of such an arbitrator. The requirement of an express agreement in writing has been introduced as it reflects awareness and a conscious intention to waive the right to object under sub-section (5) of Section 12. A clear manifestation of the expression of waiver assumes greater importance in light of the fact that the parties are overcoming a restriction imposed by law. 80. It is in the same breath we say that appointment of an arbitrator with the consent of both parties is the general rule, while unilateral appointment is an exception. When one party appoints an arbitrator unilaterally, even if its own consent is implicit, the consent of the opposite party stands compromised, and the choice of the former is effectively imposed upon the latter. 81. It is only through an express agreement in writing, waiving the bar under sub-section (5) of Section 12, that the other party can be said to have voluntarily consented to the unilateral appointment of such an arbitrator. The proviso conveys that the arbitrator, although ineligible to be appointed, yet can continue to perform his functions, as it is oriented towards facilitating party autonomy. Thus, the proviso reinforces party autonomy and equal treatment of parties in arbitration. 82. In other words, even though the appointment had been made by one of the parties, by the act of entering into an agreement in writing, the other party expresses its consent. The manner of the agreement prescribed by the statute demonstrates voluntariness by the parties. 83. In a case of unilateral appointment, the waiver mentioned in the proviso is an indication of party autonomy in two ways: first, that the parties, by entering into an agreement, are waiving the bar under Section 12(5). Secondly, by the act of entering into an agreement, the parties, more particularly, the non-consenting party, are expressing their consent for appointment of the proposed arbitrator. [2026] 1 S.C.R. 69 Bhadra International (India) Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. v. Airports Authority of India 84. Undoubtedly, the statute does not prescribe a format for the agreement. However, the absence of a prescribed format cannot be construed to mean that the waiver may be inferred impliedly or through conduct. We say so because the legislature has consciously prefaced the term \"agreement\" with the word \"express\" and followed it with the phrase \"in writing\". This semantics denote the intention of the legislature that the waiver under the proviso to Section 12(5) must be made only through an express and written manifestation of intention. 85. The conscious use of the prefatory expression also serves to differentiate such waiver from 'deemed waiver' as stipulated under Section 4 of the Act, 1996. We must be mindful of the fact that if the legislature intended that waiver under Section 12(5) could similarly arise by implication or conduct as mentioned under Section 4, it would have refrained from introducing a heightened and mandatory requirement, more particularly, in light of the rigours of the Seventh Schedule. The statutory design therefore makes it evident that the bar under Section 12(5) can be removed only by a clear, unequivocal, and written agreement executed after the dispute has arisen, and not by any form of tacit acceptance or procedural participation. 86. The mandate of an express agreement in writing in the present case may looked at from one another angle. The unilateral appointment of an arbitrator is assessed from the viewpoint of the parties. However, when the parties later execute an express written agreement waiving the ineligibility of the proposed arbitrator, the position gets altered. Such written waiver supplies the very consent that was previously missing, thereby placing the appointment on the same footing as a mutually agreed appointment and addresses concerns regarding neutrality and fairness. 87. In Bharat Broadband (supra), this Court categorically held that the expression \"express agreement in writing\" refers to an agreement made in words and cannot be inferred by conduct. The word \"express\" denotes that the agreement must be entered into with complete knowledge that although the proposed arbitrator is ineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator, yet they express their confidence in him to continue as the arbitrator. The relevant observations read thus:- \"20. This then brings us to the applicability of the proviso to Section 12(5) on the facts of this case. Unlike Section\n\n70 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports 4 of the Act which deals with deemed waiver of the right to object by conduct, the proviso to Section 12(5) will only apply if subsequent to disputes having arisen between the parties, the parties waive the applicability of sub-section (5) of Section 12 by an express agreement in writing. For this reason, the argument based on the analogy of Section 7 of the Act must also be rejected. Section 7 deals with arbitration agreements that must be in writing, and then explains that such agreements may be contained in documents which provide a record of such agreements. On the other hand, Section 12(5) refers to an \"express agreement in writing\". The expression \"express agreement in writing\" refers to an agreement made in words as opposed to an agreement which is to be inferred by conduct. Here, Section 9 of the Contract Act, 1872 becomes important. It states: \"9. Promises, express and implied.--Insofar as the proposal or acceptance of any promise is made in words, the promise is said to be express. Insofar as such proposal or acceptance is made otherwise than in words, the promise is said to be implied.\" It is thus necessary that there be an \"express\" agreement in writing. This agreement must be an agreement by which both parties, with full knowledge of the fact that Shri Khan is ineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator, still go ahead and say that they have full faith and confidence in him to continue as such. The facts of the present case disclose no such express agreement. The appointment letter which is relied upon by the High Court as indicating an express agreement on the facts of the case is dated 17-1-2017. On this date, the Managing Director of the appellant was certainly not aware that Shri Khan could not be appointed by him as Section 12(5) read with the Seventh Schedule only went to the invalidity of the appointment of the Managing Director himself as an arbitrator. Shri Khan's invalid appointment only became clear after the declaration of the law by the Supreme Court in TRF Ltd. [TRF Ltd. v. Energo Engg. Projects Ltd., (2017) 8 SCC 377 : (2017) 4 SCC (Civ) 72] which, as we have seen hereinabove, was only on [2026] 1 S.C.R. 71 Bhadra International (India) Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. v. Airports Authority of India 3-7-2017. After this date, far from there being an express agreement between the parties as to the validity of Shri Khan's appointment, the appellant filed an application on 7-10-2017 before the sole arbitrator, bringing the arbitrator's attention to the judgment in TRF Ltd. [TRF Ltd. v. Energo Engg. Projects Ltd., (2017) 8 SCC 377 : (2017) 4 SCC (Civ) 72] and asking him to declare that he has become de jure incapable of acting as an arbitrator. Equally, the fact that a statement of claim may have been filed before the arbitrator, would not mean that there is an express agreement in words which would make it clear that both parties wish Shri Khan to continue as arbitrator despite being ineligible to act as such. This being the case, the impugned judgment is not correct when it applies Section 4, Section 7, Section 12(4), Section 13(2) and Section 16(2) of the Act to the facts of the present case, and goes on to state that the appellant cannot be allowed to raise the issue of eligibility of an arbitrator, having itself appointed the arbitrator. The judgment under appeal is also incorrect in stating that there is an express waiver in writing from the fact that an appointment letter has been issued by the appellant, and a statement of claim has been filed by the respondent before the arbitrator. The moment the appellant came to know that Shri Khan's appointment itself would be invalid, it filed an application before the sole arbitrator for termination of his mandate.\" (Emphasis supplied) 88. In CORE II (supra), this Court underscored the rationale behind the first two essentials of the proviso. It reads thus:- \"121. An objection to the bias of an adjudicator can be waived. [Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Assn. v. Union of India, (2016) 5 SCC 808, para 30 : (2016) 3 SCC (Civ) 492 : (2016) 3 SCC (Cri) 173 : (2016) 2 SCC (L&S) 253] A waiver is an intentional relinquishment of a right by a party or an agreement not to assert a right. [State of Punjab v. Davinder Pal Singh Bhullar, (2011) 14 SCC 770, para 41 : (2012) 4 SCC (Civ) 1034 : (2012) 4 SCC (Cri) 496 : (2014) 1 SCC (L&S) 208] The Arbitration 72 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports Act allows parties to waive the application of Section 12(5) by an express agreement after the disputes have arisen. However, the waiver is subject to two factors. First, the parties can only waive the applicability of Section 12(5) after the dispute has arisen. This allows parties to determine whether they will be required or necessitated to draw upon the services of specific individuals as arbitrators to decide upon specific issues. To this effect, Explanation 3 to the Seventh Schedule recognises that certain kinds of arbitration such as maritime or commodities arbitration may require the parties to draw upon a small, specialised pool. [ \"Explanation 3.--For the removal of doubts, it is clarified that it may be the practice in certain specific kinds of arbitration, such as maritime or commodities arbitration, to draw arbitrators from a small, specialised pool. If in such fields it is the custom and practice for parties frequently, to appoint the same arbitrator in different cases, this is a relevant fact to be taken into account while applying the rules set out above.\"] The second requirement of the proviso to Section 12(5) is that parties must consciously abandon their existing legal right through an express agreement. Thus, the Arbitration Act reinforces the autonomy of parties by allowing them to override the limitations of independence and impartiality by an express agreement in that regard.\" (Emphasis supplied) 89. What can be discerned from the above discussion is that the ineligibility of an arbitrator can be waived only by an express agreement in writing. In the present case, there is no agreement in writing, after the disputes arose, waiving the ineligibility of the sole arbitrator or the right to object under Section 12(5) of the Act, 1996. 90. The conduct of the parties is inconsequential and does not constitute a valid waiver under the proviso. The requirement of the waiver to be made expressly in the form of agreement in writing ensures that parties are not divested of their right to object inadvertently or by procedural happenstance. 91. We are not impressed by the aforesaid submission of the respondent for all the reasons stated above. The following decisions of this\n\n[2026] 1 S.C.R. 73 Bhadra International (India) Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. v. Airports Authority of India Court and the High Court of Delhi respectively deal with the all the factual submissions made by the respondent to submit that the present case falls within the proviso to Section 12(5) of the Act, 1996. b. \"Statement of Claim\" as a parameter of waiver 92. One another submission that was canvassed on behalf of the respondent herein is that the appellants participated in the arbitral proceedings by submitting their statement of claim wherein it was stated that they submit to the jurisdiction of the arbitrator. The observations of this Court in paragraph 20 of Bharat Broadband (supra) squarely cover this issue. It was held that filing a statement of claim cannot be equated to an \"express agreement in writing\" in terms of proviso to Section 12(5). c. \"Extension of Time\" under Section 29A of the Act, 1996 as a parameter of waiver 93. Recently, in Hindustan Construction Co. Ltd. v. Bihar Rajya Pul Nirman Nigam Ltd., reported in 2025 SCC OnLine SC 2578, wherein one of us, J. B. Pardiwala, J., was a part of the Bench, held that Section 29A amounts to a valid waiver under Section 4, save in cases of statutory ineligibility under Section 12(5) of the Act, 1996. The relevant observations read thus:- \"13.8. In the present case, the respondents had ample opportunity to object. Instead, both parties jointly moved for extension under Section 29A, not once but thrice. This leads directly to the interplay between Sections 4, 12(5) and 29A. 13.9. Section 29A empowers courts to extend the mandate of an arbitral tribunal, either on a party's application or upon sufficient cause. Its object is to prevent termination of proceedings by efflux of time and to ensure continuity. A joint application under Section 29A stands on a distinct footing from ordinary acts of participation such as filing pleadings. When both parties jointly seek an extension, they signify continued consent and confidence in the tribunal. Under Section 29A(5), even a single party may apply; the other is free to oppose. The Court may, in its 74 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports discretion, extend the mandate with or without substituting the arbitrator. 13.10. Thus, when a party joins in seeking extension under Section 29A despite having the opportunity to object or seek termination, it signifies a higher degree of consent. However, such consent cannot be equated with an express written waiver under Section 12(5). The statutory language is categorical: only an express written post-dispute waiver can cure Seventh Schedule ineligibility.\" (Emphasis supplied) 94. In Man Industries (India) Ltd. v. Indian Oil Corporation Ltd., reported in 2023 SCC OnLine Del 3537, the petitioner had filed two applications under Section 29A of the Act, 1996, seeking an extension of time for completion of the arbitral proceedings. The respondent therein had contended that filing of an application under Section 29A would satisfy the requirement of the proviso to Section 12(5), and that the ineligibility attached to the sole arbitrator would thereby stand removed. The Court observed thus:- \"11. He submits that in the present case, the petitioner has never challenged the eligibility of the learned Sole Arbitrator to adjudicate on the disputes between the parties. He submits that, in fact, the learned Arbitrator was appointed at the request of the petitioner. The learned Arbitrator before entering upon the reference submitted his disclosure as required under Section 12 of the Act. The petitioner never raised any objection to the eligibility of the learned Sole Arbitrator. Thereafter, the petitioner, in fact, twice filed applications under Section 29A of the Act seeking extension of the mandate of the learned Arbitrator. He submits that the filing of the application under Section 29A of the Act by the petitioner would, in fact, satisfy the Proviso to Section 12(5) of the Act and the ineligibility, if at all, attached to the learned Sole Arbitrator would be waived. xxx 22. In view of the above authorities, there can be no doubt that the learned Arbitrator appointed by the respondent was de jure ineligible to act as such. The petitioner by its\n\n[2026] 1 S.C.R. 75 Bhadra International (India) Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. v. Airports Authority of India participation in the arbitration proceedings or by its filing of applications under Section 29A of the Act seeking extension of the mandate of the learned Arbitrator, cannot be said to have waived the ineligibility of the learned Arbitrator under Section 12(5) of the Act, and, therefore, the Arbitral Award passed by the learned Arbitrator is invalid.\" (Emphasis supplied) d. \"Continued Participation\" as a parameter of waiver 95. In Govind Singh v. Satya Group Pvt. Ltd., reported in 2023 SCC OnLine Del 37, the contention before the Delhi High Court was that the appellant therein by its conduct had waived its right to object to the unilateral appointment of the sole arbitrator. The Court categorically held that it is not necessary to even examine whether the appellant had raised an objection. Even if the appellant had participated in the proceedings without raising any objection, it cannot be said that he had waived his right under Section 12(5) of the Act, 1996. The relevant observations read thus:- \"19. The contention that the appellant by its conduct has waived its right to object to the appointment of the learned Arbitrator is also without merit. The question whether a party can, by its conduct, waive its right under Section 12(5) of the A&C Act is no longer res integra. The Supreme Court in the case of Bharat Broadband Network Limited v. United Telecoms Limited : (2019) 5 SCC 755 had explained that any waiver under Section 12(5) of the A&C Act would be valid only if it is by an express agreement in writing. There is no scope for imputing any implied waiver of the rights under Section 12(5) of the A&C Act by conduct or otherwise.[…] 20. Thus, it is not necessary to examine the question whether the appellant had raised an objection to the appointment of the learned Arbitrator. Even if it is assumed that the appellant had participated in the arbitral proceedings without raising any objection to the appointment of the learned Arbitrator, it is not open to hold that he had waived his right under Section 12(5) of 76 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports the A&C Act. Although it is not material, the record does indicate that the appellant had objected to the appointment of respondent no. 2 as an arbitrator.\" (Emphasis supplied) 96. The net effect of the aforesaid is that a notice invoking the arbitration clause under Section 21 of the Act, 1996, a procedural order, submission of statement of claim by the appellants, the filing an application seeking interim relief, or a reply to an application under Section 33 of the Act, 1996, cannot be countenanced to mean \"an express agreement in writing\" within the meaning of the proviso to sub-section (5) of Section 12 of the Act, 1996. 97. One could argue that a miscreant party may participate in the arbitral proceedings up to the passing of the award, despite having full knowledge of the arbitrator's ineligibility. While after an adverse award is rendered, such a party may then seek to challenge it with a view to having it set aside. Such an apprehension is reasonable, however, to obviate the possibility of such misuse, the party making unilateral appointment must endeavour to enter into an express written agreement as stipulated in the proviso to Section 12(5), so as to safeguard the proceedings from being rendered futile. 98. Thus, all the High Court decisions taking a contrary view to the present judgment would stand overruled. iii. Whether the appellants could have raised an objection to the appointment of the sole arbitrator for the first time in an application under Section 34 of the Act, 1996? 99. It was submitted by the appellants that an objection in relation to de jure ineligibility of the sole arbitrator could be raised at any stage, including for the first time in proceedings under Section 34 of the Act, 1996. In this regard reliance was placed on Section 34(2)(b) which empowers the court to set aside an award if \"the Court finds that\" it is in conflict with the public policy of India. Therefore, even if the objection to unilateral appointment is not raised by a party, the Court may itself declare an award to be null and void due to unilateral appointment of the arbitrator in terms of Section 34(2)(b). 100. On the contrary, the respondent submitted that since the appellants did not raise any objection to the constitution, appointment or [2026] 1 S.C.R. 77 Bhadra International (India) Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. v. Airports Authority of India jurisdiction of the sole arbitrator under Sections 13 or 14 of the Act, 1996, respectively, during the pendency of the arbitration, they are barred from raising it under an application under Section 34. 101. On the aforesaid issue, the High Court held that the present case cannot be equated with cases in which an objection to the appointment of the arbitrator has been raised throughout the proceedings, or at every stage. Further, even after sub-section (5) of Section 12 was introduced in the statute, the appellants did not approach the court under Section 14 of the Act, 1996, challenging the jurisdiction of the arbitrator. Thus, the challenge to the appointment of the sole arbitrator was clearly an \"afterthought\". a. Challenge to the ineligibility of the arbitrator during the proceedings 102. The law in this regard is fairly settled. Where a party is aggrieved by the ineligibility of an arbitrator under Section 12(5), it may directly approach the court under Section 14 of the Act, 1996. There is no doubt that when an arbitrator is ineligible under Section 12(5), i.e., he lacks inherent jurisdiction to hold the position, his mandate stands automatically terminated, and it is not necessary for the parties to challenge his appointment under Section 12 read with Section 13. When such a challenge is made, the court is required to determine whether the arbitrator suffers from de jure inability under Section 14(1)(a) of the Act, 1996. 103. An application under Section 14 is made for the purpose of terminating the mandate of the arbitrator, and, consequently, a substitute arbitrator is appointed in terms of Section 15(2). As regards where the mandate of the arbitrator has been terminated with the consent of both the parties under Section 15(1)(b), it is not required for the parties to approach the court to seek termination of the mandate of the arbitrator, because it has been terminated by the parties themselves. 104. It is apposite to understand that in a case of ineligibility of the arbitrator, the substitution of the arbitrator is sought because the termination of mandate of the arbitrator does not result in the termination of arbitral proceedings. The proceedings remain intact, only the composition of the arbitral tribunal changes. The termination of mandate of the arbitrator is distinguishable from the termination of the arbitral proceedings and of the arbitral tribunal as well. By substitution of 78 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports the arbitrator, the proceedings would commence from thereon and save the parties from initiating fresh proceedings. 105. In HRD (supra), it was held that once an arbitrator becomes ineligible to act as an arbitrator, he is rendered de jure incapable of performing his functions. In such circumstances, it is not necessary for the parties to approach the arbitral tribunal under Section 13, for an arbitrator who is de jure ineligible lacks the inherent jurisdiction to proceed any further. In such a case, an application under Section 14(2) must be filed before the court for termination of the mandate of the arbitrator. The relevant observations read thus:- \"12. […] Once he becomes ineligible, it is clear that, under Section 14(1)(a), he then becomes de jure unable to perform his functions inasmuch as, in law, he is regarded as \"ineligible\". In order to determine whether an arbitrator is de jure unable to perform his functions, it is not necessary to go to the Arbitral Tribunal under Section 13. Since such a person would lack inherent jurisdiction to proceed any further, an application may be filed under Section 14(2) to the Court to decide on the termination of his/her mandate on this ground. As opposed to this, in a challenge where grounds stated in the Fifth Schedule are disclosed, which give rise to justifiable doubts as to the arbitrator's independence or impartiality, such doubts as to independence or impartiality have to be determined as a matter of fact in the facts of the particular challenge by the Arbitral Tribunal under Section 13. If a challenge is not successful, and the Arbitral Tribunal decides that there are no justifiable doubts as to the independence or impartiality of the arbitrator/arbitrators, the Tribunal must then continue the arbitral proceedings under Section 13(4) and make an award. It is only after such award is made, that the party challenging the arbitrator's appointment on grounds contained in the Fifth Schedule may make an application for setting aside the arbitral award in accordance with Section 34 on the aforesaid grounds.[…].\" (Emphasis supplied) 106. We may refer with profit to the decision of this Court in Bharat Broadband (supra), wherein it was observed that when a person\n\n[2026] 1 S.C.R. 79 Bhadra International (India) Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. v. Airports Authority of India becomes \"ineligible\" to be appointed as an arbitrator, the challenge to such appointment does not lie before the arbitrator himself. It was further observed that an appointment hit by Section 12(5) attracts Section 14(1)(a), as the arbitrator becomes de jure unable to perform his functions. As a result, the mandate of the arbitrator stands terminated. The relevant observations read thus:- \"17. […] However, where such person becomes \"ineligible\" to be appointed as an arbitrator, there is no question of challenge to such arbitrator, before such arbitrator. In such a case i.e. a case which falls under Section 12(5), Section 14(1)(a) of the Act gets attracted inasmuch as the arbitrator becomes, as a matter of law (i.e. de jure), unable to perform his functions under Section 12(5), being ineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator. This being so, his mandate automatically terminates, and he shall then be substituted by another arbitrator under Section 14(1) itself. It is only if a controversy occurs concerning whether he has become de jure unable to perform his functions as such, that a party has to apply to the Court to decide on the termination of the mandate, unless otherwise agreed by the parties. Thus, in all Section 12(5) cases, there is no challenge procedure to be availed of. If an arbitrator continues as such, being de jure unable to perform his functions, as he falls within any of the categories mentioned in Section 12(5), read with the Seventh Schedule, a party may apply to the Court, which will then decide on whether his mandate has terminated. Questions which may typically arise under Section 14 may be as to whether such person falls within any of the categories mentioned in the Seventh Schedule, or whether there is a waiver as provided in the proviso to Section 12(5) of the Act.[…].\" (Emphasis supplied) 107. In Chennai Metro Rail Ltd. v. Transtonnelstroy Afcons (JV), reported in (2024) 6 SCC 211, this Court held that a party aggrieved by the ineligibility of an arbitrator may approach the court under Section 14(1)(a) of the Act, 1996. The relevant observations read thus:- 80 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports \"29. At this stage it would be crucial to notice that the Court made a differentiation. It stated, firstly, that a disclosure in writing about circumstances likely to give justifiable doubts is to be made, at the stage of appointment, and then stated that the disclosure can be challenged under Sections 12(1) to 12(4) read with Section 13. The Court however underlined that in the next category where the person became ineligible to be appointed as arbitrator, there was no need for a challenge to be laid before the arbitrator. In such circumstances outlined in Section 12(5), the party aggrieved could directly approach the court under Section 14(1)(a). It was further underlined that in all cases under Section 12(5), there is no challenge procedure to be availed of and that if the arbitrator continues at such, the ground of being unable to perform his function since he falls in any of the categories enumerated in the Seventh Schedule, the party concerned may apply to the court. xxx 33. The decisions in HRD [HRD Corpn. v. GAIL, (2018) 12 SCC 471 : (2018) 5 SCC (Civ) 401] and Bharat Broadband [Bharat Broadband Network Ltd. v. United Telecoms Ltd., (2019) 5 SCC 755 : (2019) 3 SCC (Civ) 1] are unequivocal and to the effect that the issue of bias should be raised before the same Tribunal at the earliest opportunity. The advertence of the time-limit of 15 days is nothing but a statutory incorporation of that idea. However, when the grounds enumerated in the Seventh Schedule occur or are brought to the notice of one party unless such party expressly waives its objections, it is ipso facto sufficient for that party, to say that the Tribunal's mandate is automatically terminated. The party aggrieved then can go ahead and challenge the Tribunal's continuation with the proceedings under Section 14.\" (Emphasis supplied) 108. The Constitution Bench in CORE II (supra) affirmed the aforementioned decisions and reiterated that the ineligibility of a person to act as an arbitrator is a matter of law and goes to the root of the appointment.\n\n[2026] 1 S.C.R. 81 Bhadra International (India) Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. v. Airports Authority of India Thus, when an arbitrator is de jure unable to perform his function, his mandate would be automatically terminated under Section 14(1) (a), and the parties would be within their rights to apply to the court under Section 14(2) for termination of the arbitrator's mandate and appointment of a substituted arbitrator. b. Challenge to the ineligibility of the arbitrator after arbitral award has been passed 109. When an award has been passed, the proceedings before the arbitral tribunal conclude, leaving no possibility of substituting the arbitrator at this stage. In other words, once an award is passed, the mandate of the arbitral tribunal also arrives at a conclusion. In such circumstances, a party aggrieved by the arbitrator's ineligibility may challenge the award by filing an application under Section 34 of the 1996 Act, as an award passed by an ineligible arbitrator is nullity, non-est, or void ab initio, and against the public policy of India. 110. Even where an interim award has been passed, it is liable to be set aside, as it is not capable of being enforced. The fate of an interim award and that of an arbitral award, in this regard, is identical. In either circumstance, the parties would be required to initiate fresh arbitration proceedings as per law. In Alpro Industries v. Ambience (P) Ltd., reported in 2025 SCC OnLine Del 8373, the petitioner assailed an interim award under Section 34 on the primary ground of unilateral appointment. The Court observed thus:- \"41.⁠ ⁠In light of the findings in Mahavir Prasad (supra) and my findings that the unilateral appointment of the Sole Arbitrator in the present case is invalid and there has been no express waiver in writing in terms of the proviso to clause 12(5) of the Act, the Impugned Interim Award is liable to be set aside. Consequently, the issue raised by the respondents as to whether the Impugned Interim Award constitutes an 'interim award' or not would not be relevant. The Court cannot permit continuation of arbitral proceedings before an Arbitral Tribunal which would be a nullity and cannot result into an enforceable award. Hence, I do not deem it necessary to go into the merits of the challenge to the Impugned Interim Award.\" (Emphasis supplied) 82 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports 111. An award passed by an arbitrator who is found to be ineligible cannot be enforced. In CORE II (supra), a Constitution Bench of this Court held that the concept of \"public policy of India\" and \"fundamental policy of Indian law\" means complying with statues and judicial precedents, and principles of natural justice. It was categorically held that \"the most basic notions of morality and justice\" mentioned in the Explanation 1 to Section 34(b) includes bias. The observations of this Court in paragraphs 163 and 164 respectively reproduced hereinbelow squarely apply to the facts of the present case. The relevant extract has been reproduced thus:- \"158. Section 34(2)(b) specifically provides that an arbitral award may be set aside if the court finds that the arbitral award conflicts with the public policy of India. The provision further clarifies \"public policy of India\" to only mean that : (i) the making of the award was induced or affected by fraud or corruption or was in violation of Section 75 or Section 81; (ii) it is in contravention with the fundamental policy of Indian law; or (iii) it is in conflict with the most basic notions of morality or justice. 159. This Court has construed the expression \"public policy of India\" appearing under Section 34 to mean the \"fundamental policy of Indian law\". [Ssangyong Engg. & Construction Co. Ltd. v. NHAI, (2019) 15 SCC 131, para 34 : (2020) 2 SCC (Civ) 213; NHAI v. P. Nagaraju, (2022) 15 SCC 1 : (2024) 2 SCC (Civ) 414, para 39] The concept of \"fundamental policy of Indian law\" has been held to cover compliance with statutes and judicial precedents, adopting a judicial approach, and compliance with the principles of natural justice. [MMTC Ltd. v. Vedanta Ltd., (2019) 4 SCC 163, para 11 : (2019) 2 SCC (Civ) 293] In OPG Power Generation (India) (P) Ltd. v. Enexio Power Cooling Solutions (India) (P) Ltd. [OPG Power Generation (India) (P) Ltd. v. Enexio Power Cooling Solutions (India) (P) Ltd., (2025) 2 SCC 417 : (2025) 1 SCC (Civ) 54] , this Court explained the concept of \"fundamental policy of Indian law\" thus : (SCC pp. 467-68, paras 55-56) \"55. … The expression \"in contravention with the fundamental policy of Indian law\" by use of the word [2026] 1 S.C.R. 83 Bhadra International (India) Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. v. Airports Authority of India \"fundamental\" before the phrase \"policy of Indian law\" makes the expression narrower in its application than the phrase \"in contravention with the policy of Indian law\", which means mere contravention of law is not enough to make an award vulnerable. To bring the contravention within the fold of fundamental policy of Indian law, the award must contravene all or any of such fundamental principles that provide a basis for administration of justice and enforcement of law in this country. 56. Without intending to exhaustively enumerate instances of such contravention, by way of illustration, it could be said that (a) violation of the principles of natural justice; (b) disregarding orders of superior courts in India or the binding effect of the judgment of a superior court; and (c) violating law of India linked to public good or public interest, are considered contravention of the fundamental policy of Indian law.\" 160. In Avitel Post Studioz Ltd. v. HSBC PI Holdings (Mauritius) Ltd. [Avitel Post Studioz Ltd. v. HSBC PI Holdings (Mauritius) Ltd., (2024) 7 SCC 197, para 34 : (2024) 3 SCC (Civ) 780] , this Court held that the most basic notions of morality and justice under the concept of \"public policy\" will include bias. 161. […] As a corollary, Section 34 places a responsibility on the Arbitral Tribunals to ensure that the arbitral proceedings are consistent with the fundamental policy of Indian law. [Vidya Drolia v. Durga Trading Corpn., (2021) 2 SCC 1, pp. 69-70, para 70:\"70. Arbitrators, like the courts, are equally bound to resolve and decide disputes in accordance with the public policy of the law. Possibility of failure to abide by public policy consideration in a legislation, which otherwise does not expressly or by necessary implication exclude arbitration, cannot form the basis to overwrite and nullify the arbitration agreement. This would be contrary to and defeat\n\n84 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports the legislative intent reflected in the public policy objective behind the Arbitration Act. Arbitration has considerable advantages as it gives freedom to the parties to choose an arbitrator of their choice, and it is informal,flexible and quick. Simplicity, informality and expedition are hallmarks of arbitration. Arbitrators are required to be impartial and independent, adhere to natural justice, and follow a fair and just procedure. Arbitrators are normally experts in the subject and perform their tasks by referring to facts, evidence, and relevant case law.\"] xxx 163. The possibility of bias is real in situations where an arbitration clause allows a government company to unilaterally appoint a sole arbitrator or control the majority of the arbitrators. Since the Government has control over the Arbitral Tribunal, it can chart the course of the arbitration proceedings to the prejudice of the other party. Resultantly, unilateral appointment clauses fail to provide an effective substitute for judicial proceedings in India. Further, a unilateral appointment clause is inherently exclusionary and violates the principle of equal treatment of parties and procedural equality. 164. Unilateral appointment clauses in a public-private contract fail to provide the minimum level of integrity required in authorities performing quasi-judicial functions such as Arbitral Tribunals. Therefore, a unilateral appointment clause is against the principle of arbitration, that is, impartial resolution of disputes between parties. It also violates the nemo judex rule which constitutes the public policy of India in the context of arbitration. Therefore, unilateral appointment clauses in public-private contracts are violative of Article 14 of the Constitution for being arbitrary in addition to being violative of the equality principle under the Arbitration Act.\" (Emphasis supplied) 112. What emerges from the foregoing is that the appellants were well within their right to challenge the ineligibility of the sole arbitrator in an application under Section 34 of the Act, 1996. [2026] 1 S.C.R. 85 Bhadra International (India) Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. v. Airports Authority of India c. Challenge to the ineligibility of the arbitrator at any stage of the proceedings 113. A challenge to an arbitrator's ineligibility could be raised at any stage because an award passed in such circumstance is non-est, i.e., it carries no enforceability or recognition in law. We say so because an arbitrator does not possess the jurisdiction to pass an award. In arbitration, the parties vest the jurisdiction in the tribunal by virtue of a valid arbitration agreement and an appointment made in accordance with the provisions of the Act, 1996. This jurisdiction is grounded in the consent of the parties as explained in the foregoing paragraphs of this judgment. 114. In this context, jurisdiction means the authority of an arbitral tribunal to render a decision affecting the merits of the case. An arbitrator who lacks jurisdiction cannot make an award on the merits. With a view to dispel any doubt and lend clarity, we deem it appropriate to observe that the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal is distinct from the admissibility of the dispute, i.e., the arbitrability of the claims. 115. A question pertaining to the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal arises when the tribunal is fundamentally incompetent to render any decision at all. In other words, a question of jurisdiction pertains to the ability of the tribunal to hear a case, whereas questions of admissibility presuppose that the tribunal has jurisdiction. An award passed by an arbitrator who does not have jurisdiction strikes at the very authority of the arbitrator. 116. This Court, in catena of decisions, has held that the validity of a decree can be challenged even in execution proceedings if the court passing such decree lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the dispute. As a decree passed by a court without jurisdiction goes to the root of the matter. Any decision passed by a court lacking jurisdiction would be coram non judice, since a court cannot give itself jurisdiction. No act of the parties can cure an inherent lack of jurisdiction. 117. In Hira Lal Patni v. Kali Nath, reported in 1961 SCC OnLine SC 42, this Court held that competence of a court to decide a case goes to the root of the matter, and incompetency results in inherent lack of jurisdiction. As a result, a decision rendered by a court that lacks jurisdiction is a nullity. The relevant observations read thus:-\n\n86 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports \"4. […] The validity of a decree can be challenged in execution proceedings only on the ground that the court which passed the decree was lacking in inherent jurisdiction in the sense that it could not have seisin of the case because the subject-matter was wholly foreign to its jurisdiction or that the defendant was dead at the time the suit had been instituted or decree passed, or some such other ground which could have the effect of rendering the court entirely lacking in jurisdiction in respect of the subject-matter of the suit or over the parties to it. But in the instant case there was no such inherent lack of jurisdiction. The decision of the Privy Council in the case of Ledgard v. Bull [13 Indian Appeals 134] is an authority for the proposition that consent or waiver can cure defect of jurisdiction but cannot cure inherent lack of jurisdiction. In that case, the suit had been instituted in the Court of the Subordinate Judge, who was incompetent to try it. By consent of the parties, the case was transferred to the Court of the District Judge for convenience of trial. It was laid down by the Privy Council that as the court in which the suit had been originally instituted was entirely lacking in jurisdiction, in the sense that it was incompetent to try it, whatever happened subsequently was null and void because consent of parties could not operate to confer jurisdiction on a court which was incompetent to try the suit. […] It is well settled that the objection as to local jurisdiction of a court does not stand on the same footing as an objection to the competence of a court to try a case. Competence of a court to try a case goes to the very root of the jurisdiction, and where it is lacking, it is a case of inherent lack of jurisdiction. On the other hand, an objection as to the local jurisdiction of a court can be waived and this principle has been given a statutory recognition by enactments like Section 21 of the Code of Civil Procedure.[…]\" (Emphasis supplied) 118. We may look into the decision of this Court in Hindustan Zinc Ltd. v. Ajmer Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd., reported in (2019) 17 SCC 82. The submission canvassed before this Court was that an objection to jurisdiction could not have been raised in a proceeding [2026] 1 S.C.R. 87 Bhadra International (India) Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. v. Airports Authority of India under Section 37 of the Act, 1996, once the parties had consented to arbitration. In the said decision it was held that an objection to the inherent lack of jurisdiction can be taken at any stage and also in collateral proceedings. Furthermore, that a decree passed without jurisdiction is a nullity. The relevant observations read thus:- \"17. We are of the view that it is settled law that if there is an inherent lack of jurisdiction, the plea can be taken up at any stage and also in collateral proceedings. This was held by this Court in Kiran Singh v. Chaman Paswan [Kiran Singh v. Chaman Paswan, (1955) 1 SCR 117 : AIR 1954 SC 340] as follows : (SCR p. 121 : AIR p. 342, para 6) \"6. … It is a fundamental principle well-established that a decree passed by a court without jurisdiction is a nullity, and that its invalidity could be set up whenever and wherever it is sought to be enforced or relied upon, even at the stage of execution and even in collateral proceedings. A defect of jurisdiction, whether it is pecuniary or territorial, or whether it is in respect of the subject-matter of the action, strikes at the very authority of the Court to pass any decree, and such a defect cannot be cured even by consent of parties. If the question now under consideration fell to be determined only on the application of general principles governing the matter, there can be no doubt that the District Court of Monghyr was coram non judice, and that its judgment and decree would be nullities.\" 18. Therefore, it is a little difficult to countenance Shri Vaidyanathan's argument that having consented, the respondent cannot now turn around and challenge the very appointment of the arbitrator as being invalid and without jurisdiction.\" (Emphasis supplied) 119. In Bhim Bahadur v. Vikram Singh, reported in 2015 SCC OnLine Utt 1563, when the issue before the High Court was whether the subject land therein was agricultural or abadi in nature. The Court held that the matter had to be referred to a revenue court under the Uttar Pradesh Zamindari Abolition & Land Reforms Act. The relevant observations read thus:-\n\n88 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports \"11. In this regard, the law is well established to the effect that competency of the jurisdiction or the lack of the same in a particular Court cannot be determined by either of the parties through their pleadings, viz., the Court having jurisdiction under the law to decide a particular issue cannot be kept away from deciding the same on the basis of averments made by the parties and, in the same manner, the jurisdiction cannot be conferred on a particular Court on the basis of pleadings and admission thereof to decide a particular issue wherefor the law does not confer jurisdiction to the Court.\" (Emphasis supplied) 120. All that we are trying to convey is that, in civil law, the law itself confers subject-matter jurisdiction on specific courts. For instance, a suit seeking a declaration on the validity of marriage before the Civil Court is not maintainable, as such disputes fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Family Court. Similarly, in arbitration, the consent of parties confers subject-matter jurisdiction, i.e., the authority to decide the dispute. When an arbitral tribunal is unilaterally constituted, such consent is absent, thereby divesting the tribunal of subject-matter jurisdiction. The Act, 1996, does not recognize the conferral of jurisdiction on an arbitral tribunal without the consent of the parties. By entering into an express agreement in writing as per the proviso to Section 12(5), the parties not only waive the ineligibility of the proposed arbitrator but also consent to his appointment. 121. Before we part, we deem it fit to observe that an arbitrator is better equipped with the position of law on appointments, more particularly, unilateral appointments. Therefore, it becomes incumbent upon the arbitrator that upon entering reference and at the very first hearing, to ensure from the parties that they are willing to participate in the proceedings and to insist upon a written agreement waiving the requirement of Section 12(5) of the Act, 1996. 122. Further, in such circumstances referred to above, if any party does not appear despite receipt of notice, the arbitrator shall not proceed further and shall immediately withdraw from the arbitral proceedings. The arbitrator must, along with the waiver agreement, record the minutes even when the parties are cooperating. This would certainly save time and avoid multiplicity of proceedings. [2026] 1 S.C.R. 89 Bhadra International (India) Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. v. Airports Authority of India VIII. CONCLUSION 123. A conspectus of the aforesaid detailed discussion on the position of law as regards Section 12 of the Act, 1996, is as follows:- i. The principle of equal treatment of parties provided in Section 18 of the Act, 1996, applies not only to the arbitral proceedings but also to the procedure for appointment of arbitrators. Equal treatment of the parties entails that the parties must have an equal say in the constitution of the arbitral tribunal. ii. Sub-section (5) of Section 12 provides that any person whose relationship with the parties or counsel, or the dispute, whether direct or indirect, falls within any of the categories specified in the Seventh Schedule would be ineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator. Since, the ineligibility stems from the operation of law, not only is a person having an interest in the dispute or its outcome ineligible to act as an arbitrator, but appointment by such a person would be ex facie invalid. iii. The words \"an express agreement in writing\" in the proviso to Section 12(5) means that the right to object to the appointment of an ineligible arbitrator cannot be taken away by mere implication. The agreement referred to in the proviso must be a clear, unequivocal written agreement. iv. When an arbitrator is found to be ineligible by virtue of Section 12(5) read with the Seventh Schedule, his mandate is automatically terminated. In such circumstance, an aggrieved party may approach the court under Section 14 read with Section 15 for appointment of a substitute arbitrator. Whereas, when an award has been passed by such an arbitrator, an aggrieved party may approach the court under Section 34 for setting aside the award. v. In arbitration, the parties vest jurisdiction in the tribunal by exercising their consent in furtherance of a valid arbitration agreement. An arbitrator who lacks jurisdiction cannot make an award on the merits. Hence, an objection to the inherent lack of jurisdiction can be taken at any stage of the proceedings. 124. For all the foregoing reasons, we have reached the conclusion that the High Court committed an egregious error in passing the\n\n90 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports impugned judgment. We are left with no other option but to set aside the impugned judgment. As a result, the arbitral awards dated 30.07.2018 passed by the sole arbitrator are also set aside. 125. It would be open to the parties to initiate fresh arbitration proceedings in accordance with law. 126. In the result, the appeals succeed and are hereby allowed. Pending applications, if any, shall stand disposed of. Result of the case: Appeals allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan", "2026_1_91_118_EN_2026": "[2026] 1 S.C.R. 91 : 2026 INSC 7 Nirbhay Singh Suliya v. State of Madhya Pradesh & Anr.

[Concurring] Initiation of departmental proceedings on mere suspicion is one of the primary causes why trial court judges are reluctant when it comes to exercising discretion for the purpose of grant of bail - It should not happen that because of the lurking fear in the mind of a trial court judge, of some administrative action being taken that even in a deserving case, well within the principles of law, bail is declined - This is one reason why the High Courts and the Supreme Court are flooded with bail applications - Courts of the district judiciary wield powers necessary for the functioning of the justice delivery system in India and when their autonomy is compromised by higher courts and fear takes precedence over judicial duties, democracy and the rule of law suffer - Over a period of time, the trial court judges have exhibited tendency to shirk from their solemn judicial function and responsibility when it comes to exercising discretion in matters relating to bail - Courts of the district judiciary wield powers necessary for the functioning of the justice delivery system in India and when their autonomy is compromised by higher courts and fear takes precedence over judicial duties, democracy and the rule of law suffer - For functioning of democracy, an independent judiciary to dispense justice without fear and favour is paramount.

Supreme Court Reports Judgment / Order of the Supreme Court Judgment K.V. Viswanathan, J. 1. Leave granted. 2. This case highlights the unfortunate plight of a judicial officer (appellant herein) who, after 27 years of unblemished service, was removed from service. The sole and exclusive basis on which the appellant has been removed are four judicial orders by which he enlarged certain parties thereon on bail. Those four orders were contrasted with fourteen other orders of bail and after finding that in the four orders Section 59-A of the Madhya Pradesh Excise Act, 1915 (for short the \"Excise Act\") was not referred to, action has been taken. According to the High Court, in the fourteen other orders the appellant referred to the said Section implying thereby that he was conscious of the existence of the said Section on the statute. Section 59-A prescribes what has now famously come to be known as \"twin conditions\" for grant of bail. 3. The question before us is whether on facts, based on the four judicial orders of grant of bail per se and without anything more, the authorities were justified in removing the appellant from service? 4. The facts lie in a very narrow compass. The appellant joined service on 31.10.1987 as Civil Judge (Junior Division) in the Madhya Pradesh Judicial Service. The appellant scaled the ladder up and in 2003 was promoted as Additional District Judge and in September, 2008 was confirmed in the said post. On 16.05.2011, he was transferred to Khargone, District Mandaleshwar (MP), where he joined as First Additional District & Sessions Judge. In the course of discharge of his duties, he dealt with several matters, including bail applications under the Excise Act. 5. One Jaipal Mehta, a resident of Jaitapur, Khargone, lodged a complaint with the Chief Justice of the Madhya Pradesh High Court, Jabalpur. The complaint which did not set out any details of the bail orders and which was in very general terms reads as under:- \"Subject: Regarding disposal of cases under Section 34(2) of IPC. [2026] 1 S.C.R. 97 Nirbhay Singh Suliya v. State of Madhya Pradesh & Anr. Sir, In reference to above subject matter, it is requested that First ADJ Sh. Suliya posted in Khargone, District-West Nimar, Mandleshwar by taking bribe through his Steno namely Anil Joshi, Clerk, is granting bails in the cases of Section 34/2 of Excise Act i.e. of 50 Bulk Ltrs. of liquor, whereas, ADJ/Sessions Judge has no power to allow said bail applications. Said Bails are allowed by the High Court. Anil Joshi, Steno challenges in each and every case that either you bring case of 302, 307, Claim or Civil Case, I have good setting with sir, I will get it resolved, rest you have to pay money as per my wishes. Due to such corrupt employee, the judiciary is getting defamed. Injustice is being done with the aggrieved parties in place of giving them justice. Who will be responsible for it? Previously in the year 1995-196, the serious complaints of bribe were also made against the said corrupt employee, on which, no action was taken. Aforesaid employee is posted in Khargone since last 25 years and is earning money by doing setting with Advocates openly. If the enquiry of his account be conducted, then, the truth will be exposed. If, the trust of public loses confidence in judiciary then, will be possible of military rule jungle raj.\" 6. It will be seen that according to the complaint, the allegation was that the appellant was taking bribe through his steno, namely, Anil Joshi for grant of bail in cases under the Excise Act in which the quantity of seized liquor was 50 Bulk liters or more; that the said Anil Joshi was claiming that he will get the work done through the appellant for extraneous consideration; that due to such corrupt employee, the judiciary was getting defamed; that even in 1995-96, serious complaints of bribery were made against the said employee on which no action was taken; that the said employee has been posted in Khargone for more than 25 years and is earning money through illegal means and that an inquiry is essential. 7. It appears from the counter affidavit filed before this Court by R-2 - the High Court of Madhya Pradesh, that a preliminary inquiry was conducted by the District Judge (I & V), Indore Zone, Indore, against the appellant and on 06.10.2012, the Principal Registrar (I & V) put 98 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports up a note based on which it was decided to initiate departmental proceedings against the appellant. 8. What emerges is that in the preliminary inquiry certain orders passed by the appellant in bail proceedings seem to have been examined and few orders pulled out. Two charges were framed against the appellant of which the second charge admittedly was held not proved by the inquiry officer. The charges read as under:- \"Whereas, you Shri Nirbhay Singh Suliya while functioning as Additional Sessions Judge, Khargone, distt. Mandleshwar, have committed following acts which if proved would amount to grave misconduct:- ARTICLE OF CHARGE - I That, you, with corrupt of oblique motive or for some extraneous considerations, while functioning as Additional & Sessions Judge, allowed Bail Application No. 129/11 Lokesh Vs. State of MP vide order dated 1.8.11, Bail Application No. 136/11 Babulal & Ors. Vs. State vide order dated 4.8.11, Bail Application No.200/11 Mohan Vs. State of MP vide order dated 7.12.11, Bail Application No. 123/12 Jitendra & Nantiya Vs. State & No. 122/12 Gulab & Ors. Vs. State of MP, vide order dated 31-08-12, against the provisions of Section 59-A of the M.P. Excise Act wherein all the cases, quantity of seized liquor was 50 and more bulk litres. On the contrary, you rejected Bail Application No.89/11 vide order dated 16.06.2011, Bail Application No. 92/11, vide order dated 23.06.11, Bail Application No.104/11, vide order dated 1.7.2011, Bail Application No.103/11, vide order dated 4.7.11, Bail Application no. 111/11, vide order dated 11.7.11, Bail Application No. 121/11, vide order dated 21.07.11, Bail Application No.140/11, vide order dated 12.08.11, Bail Application No. 160/11 vide order dated 22.09.11 and six other bail applications in which the quantity of seized liquor was 50 bulk litres or more. In this manner you have applied double standard, malafidely, in allowing the aforesaid bail applications. ARTICLE OF CHARGE - II That, you, with corrupt or oblique motive or for some extraneous consideration allowed the first bail application [2026] 1 S.C.R. 99 Nirbhay Singh Suliya v. State of Madhya Pradesh & Anr. No. 101/2012 Pappu Vs. State of MP in Crime No. 101/2012 under section 439 of CrPC for offense punishable under 363, 366, 376(2)(g) of the IPC in a serious offence of gang rape without assigning any sufficient reason, whereas the accused was already facing trial in another similar crime no. 103/2012 PS Oon for offence punishable under sections 363, 366, 376(2)(g) 3 of the IPC. Your aforesaid acts being unbecoming of Judicial Officer amount to grave misconduct under Rule 3 of M.P. Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, 1965 and are punishable under Rule 10 of the M.P. Civil Services (Classification, Control & Appeal) Rules, 1966.\" 9. A perusal of \"Charge-I\" reveals that the orders in the following bail applications where Bail was granted to the applicants therein were the basis of the gravamen of the charge:- Bail Application Nos. Date of Order 129/2011 01.08.2011 136/2011 04.08.2011 200/2011 07.12.2011 123/2012 & 122/2012 31.08.2012 10. The charge was that for corrupt motive or that for some extraneous consideration, bail applications were allowed contrary to Section 59-A of the Excise Act. A contrast was made with 14 other bail orders, where the appellant had rejected bail. It is significant to note that among the five bail orders, Bail Application No.200/2011 that was disposed of on 07.12.2011 was actually a case where the appellant had rejected bail. Somehow that order also made its way into \"Charge-I\", as an order of grant of bail. Be that as it may. In the list of witnesses, Jaipal Mehta was named apart from a general statement - \"any other witnesses that may be felt necessary\". 11. The appellant gave his reply and dealt with each bail order that was subject matter of the charge. 12. We have perused the actual bail orders. In the bail order in Bail Application No.129/2011 (60 liters of liquor) the reasoning given was as under:- 100 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports \"After hearing arguments of both the parties, Criminal Case No.1685/11 Filed before Chief Judicial Magistrate was perused. On perusal, it is clear that on 25.07.2011, challan has been filed against both the Applicants/ Accused in violation of Section 34(2) of M.P. Excise Act, and possibility of consuming time in it's trial cannot be overruled. In view of the nature of crime, allegations, and without commenting on the merits of evidences collected in the present case i.e. Crime No. 232/11, and by placing reliance on the said case laws, where trial is likely to take time, and Applicant/Accused are theirselves [sic] being permanent resident, there is no flight risk or tempering evidences on their part, thereupon, it appears justifiable to grant benefit of bail to these Applicants/ Accused Persons. Due to this reason, the present Bail Application u/s 439 Cr.P.C. is hereby allowed.\" 13. Similarly, in other orders, reasons like filing of challan, the applicants being rural farmers with no flight risk were mentioned. There was no express reference to the twin conditions under Section 59-A(2) of the Excise Act. 14. At the inquiry, the complainant Jaipal Mehta was not examined. Instead the executive clerk of ADJ, Khargone Court, Gendalal Chauhan was examined as witness No.1, in support of the charge. The witness marked all the exhibits and categorically deposed as under which actually was in favour of the appellant :- \"It is correct to say that while passing orders, Anil Joshi was posted as Steno in the Court of First Additional Sessions Judge. He is posted in Khargone since last 7-8 years, whom I know due to being my colleague. I never seen Anil (sic) asking anyone that he has good relations with Suliya Sahab and I will get done the work by doing setting. None of the Advocates has told me that Anil Joshi has setting with Suliya Sahab.\" 15. The appellant in defense examined the prosecutor K.P. Tripathi who appeared in all the 18 bail applications which were subject matter of the charge. He deposed as under:- \"I did not feel that the double standard has been adopted by the Court. If it would happen, then, I would give my opinion\n\n[2026] 1 S.C.R. 101 Nirbhay Singh Suliya v. State of Madhya Pradesh & Anr. to the State for taking action in Hon'ble High Court. In Exh. P-19, only one Crime i.e. Crime No.102/12 is registered against Accused Pappu in P.S. Oon. Moreover, as per my knowledge, no other crime is registered against this accused. Because in Police Report, there is no mention of registration of any other crime against him. I find the functioning of Court to be completely impartial.\" …… \"That, three Bail Applications of Excise Act have been allowed, and out of the said Applications, 15 Applications have been rejected. In my opinion, in the cases of Bail marked as Exh. P-1, P-2 and P-4, those orders of allowing bail application which have been passed in view of the facts and circumstances of respective cases, nature of crime, and in pursuance of the case laws of Hon'ble High Court and Supreme Court, those orders are completely based on merits and are relevant and true as per law. Those 15 Bail Applications which have been rejected by the Ld. Trial Court, out of those cases, in the orders marked as Exh. P-9, Exh. P-12, Exh. P-13, Exh. P-17 and Exh. P-18, the case was at the initial stage of investigation.\" …… \"Note: Question by Enquiry Officer:- Question: The bail orders, in which bail applications have been allowed, whether those orders according to your goodself or in the opinion of Public Prosecutor, are proper or improper? What you say in this regard. Answer: In my opinion i.e. in the capacity of Public Prosecutor, the orders of granting bail were absolutely proper and on proper grounds.\" 16. Notwithstanding the above evidence the inquiry officer held \"Charge-I\", proved by recording the following findings:- \"Therefore, on the basis of aforesaid analysis, as a final conclusion, it is proved in favour of the Department that Delinquent Officer Sh. N.S. Suliya in the capacity of Additional Sessions Judge, not being impartial in the 102 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports disposal of Bail Applications for the offences of Section 34(2), 49-A of the Excise Act, and with oblique motive and by deliberately violating the mandatory provisions of Section 59-A of the aforesaid Act, has committed misconduct by allowing some Bail Application Nos. 129/11, 136/11, 123/12, 122/12 and by rejecting some bail Applications by applying double standards in malafide and arbitrary manner, who has violated Rule 3 of the M.P. Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, 196, which is punishable under Rule 10 of the M.P. Civil Services (Classification, Control & Appeal) Rules, 1966.\" 17. On 21.03.2014, a copy of the inquiry report was furnished to the appellant and he was asked to show cause on the punishment. The appellant filed a detailed reply by his letter dated 10.04.2014. 18. On 02.09.2014, on the recommendation of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh, order was passed by the Principal Secretary, Government of M.P., Law & Legislative Affairs Department, removing the appellant from service. A representation/appeal filed against the said order was rejected on 17.03.2016. 19. The appellant filed a writ petition before the High Court of Madhya Pradesh at Jabalpur (Writ Petition No.8623/2016) challenging the order of removal and the order of the appellate authority and prayed for reinstatement with consequential benefits. 20. By the impugned order dated 25.07.2024, the High Court has dismissed the Writ Petition by recording the following finding:- \"If the principles laid down by the Supreme Court, in the case referred to herein above, are taken note of, then a reasonable finding arrived at by the Inquiring Authority in the present case based on material available on record can neither be interfered with by this Court nor can it termed as perverse or unreasonable to such an extent that interference can be made by this Court. Considering the material available in the present case, it is apparent that the petitioner was holding the post of Additional Sessions Judge with which comes a great responsibility and he was under obligation to conduct himself in a manner befitting the post held by him. He was\n\n[2026] 1 S.C.R. 103 Nirbhay Singh Suliya v. State of Madhya Pradesh & Anr. under duty to conduct the proceedings of bail applications in conformity with the provisions of law. He extended the benefit of bail to some applicants relying on the pronouncement of High Court and refused to grant bail to others without considering those pronouncements. No violation of principles of natural justice or error is found in the procedure followed in the enquiry in the present case. In the absence of any procedural illegality, irregularity in the conduct of departmental enquiry, in the considered opinion of this Court, no interference is warranted and after considering the over all material available in the record and in view of the settled position of law, we do not find any reason to interfere in the order of punishment/removal dated 02.09.2014 and the order of rejection of appeal on 17.03.2016 and accordingly, the writ petition is dismissed.\" 21. Aggrieved, the appellant is before us. 22. We have heard Mr. Dama Seshadri Naidu, learned senior counsel assisted by Mr. Kanu Agarwal, learned counsel for the appellant and Mr. Arjun Garg, learned counsel for the respondent no. 2, the High Court of Madhya Pradesh, who ably presented the case of the said respondent. We have perused the records, including the written submissions and the compilation of case law filed by the parties. CONTENTIONS OF THE APPELLANT: - 23. Learned senior counsel for the appellant contends that the allegations were directly against Anil Joshi - the Stenographer; that neither the complainant - Jaipal Mehta nor the Stenographer was produced as witnesses during the Departmental Inquiry and that the bail orders which were subject matter of the inquiry were passed on valid grounds. Even in the case of special statute \"bail is the rule and jail is the exception\"; that the Inquiry Officer has examined the legality and propriety of the orders of bail acting as an Appellate Authority. That the departmental witness Gendalal Chauhan and the public prosecutor in their deposition did not support the charge and finally it was contended that merely because on a given set of facts, a different conclusion is possible, is no ground to indict a Judicial Officer. It was further submitted that wrong exercise of jurisdiction or mistake of law or wrong interpretation of law cannot be the basis for initiating disciplinary proceedings. 104 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports CONTENTIONS OF RESPONDENT NO.2 - THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH:- 24. The learned Counsel for the respondent no. 2 - the High Court of Madhya Pradesh submitted that the procedure for Inquiry has been duly followed; that the consistent view of this Court has been that the Court will not function as an Appellate Court over the Inquiry report and the only consideration was whether the Inquiry had been fairly conducted after giving due opportunity to the delinquent. It was further submitted that Section 59-A (2) of the Excise Act was not even referred to in the bail orders in question, while in the other bail orders it was mentioned while rejecting bail. The learned counsel submitted that the Inquiry Officer has come to the conclusion that the conduct of the appellant was not impartial and the appellant violated the mandate of Section 59-A and applied double standards in a mala fide and arbitrary manner. It was submitted that a judicial officer is required to maintain a very high standard of devotion to duty. So contending, it was pleaded that the impugned order did not call for any interference. QUESTIONS FOR CONSIDERATION: - 25. The questions for consideration are whether the order removing the appellant from service based on the inquiry report is justified in law and whether any good ground has been made out for interference? ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSION: - 26. The present is the case of a Disciplinary Inquiry against the senior Judicial Officer. Before we set out the parameters laid down by this Court as to in what circumstances a Judicial Officer can be subjected to penalty in the discharge of his duties, it is apposite to make certain preliminary observations. 27. A fearless judge is the bedrock of an independent judiciary, as much as an independent judiciary itself is the foundation on which rule of law rests. A judicial Officer is tasked with the onerous duty of deciding cases. Invariably one party to the case would lose and go back unhappy. Disgruntled elements amongst them, wanting to settle scores may raise frivolous allegations. The Trial Judiciary also has tremendous work pressure and works under trying working conditions. Large number of cases are listed in a day and most of the Judicial Officers give their very best while discharging their duties.\n\n[2026] 1 S.C.R. 105 Nirbhay Singh Suliya v. State of Madhya Pradesh & Anr. 28. Instances have also emerged from different parts of the country, where not just disgruntled parties but some mischievous elements in the Bar have also resorted to intimidatory tactics against the members of the Trial Judiciary by engineering false and anonymous complaints. Strict and strong action in accordance with law should be taken against such individuals filing a false and frivolous complaint against a judicial officer and/or if found to be engineering the false and frivolous complaints. Such proceedings would include in appropriate cases, proceedings for contempt of court. In case the person filing or engineering false and frivolous complaints is a recalcitrant member of the Bar, apart from proceedings for contempt of court, reference to the bar council should be made for disciplinary action. Bar councils, on receipt of such references, have to dispose of the matter expeditiously. 29. Equally, if the complaint of misconduct against the judicial officer is prima facie found to be true, prompt action to initiate disciplinary proceeding should be taken and no leniency should be shown if the charges are established. Not only this, in appropriate cases where criminal prosecution is warranted against a judicial officer, the High Court should not hesitate to have the same initiated. That is the only way to weed out black-sheeps sullying the fair name of the judiciary. Due care and caution must be exercised by the High Court in initiating such proceedings. It should be ensured that only because an order is wrong or there is an error of judgment, without anything more, a judicial officer is not put through the ordeal of a disciplinary proceeding or a prosecution. 30. It is trite to recall the observations of this Court in Sadhna Chaudhary v. State of U.P and Another.1:- \"20. We are also not oblivious to the fact that mere suspicion cannot constitute \"misconduct\". Any \"probability\" of misconduct needs to be supported with oral or documentary material, even though, the standard of proof would obviously not be on a par with that in a criminal trial. While applying these yardsticks, the High Court is expected to consider the existence of differing standards and approaches amongst different Judges. There are innumerable instances of judicial officers who are liberal in granting bail, awarding 1 (2020) 11 SCC 760 106 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports compensation under MACT or for acquired land, back wages to workmen or mandatory compensation in other cases of tortious liabilities. Such relief-oriented judicial approaches cannot by themselves be grounds to cast aspersions on the honesty and integrity of an officer. 21. Furthermore, one cannot overlook the reality of ours being a country, wherein countless complainants are readily available without hesitation to tarnish the image of the judiciary, often for mere pennies or even cheap momentary popularity. Sometimes, a few disgruntled members of the Bar also join hands with them, and the officers of the subordinate judiciary are usually the easiest target. It is, therefore, the duty of the High Courts to extend their protective umbrella and ensure that the upright and straightforward judicial officers are not subjected to unmerited onslaught. 26. We can find no fault in the proposition that the end result of adjudication does not matter, and only whether the delinquent officer had taken illegal gratification (monetary or otherwise) or had been swayed by extraneous considerations while conducting the process is of relevance. Indeed, many-a-times it is possible that a judicial officer can indulge in conduct unbecoming of his office whilst at the same time giving an order, the result of which is legally sound. Such unbecoming conduct can either be in the form of a Judge taking a case out of turn, delaying hearings through adjournments, seeking bribes to give parties their legal dues, etc. None of these necessarily need to affect the outcome. However, importantly in the present case, a perusal of the charge-sheet shows that no such allegation of the process having been vitiated has been made against the appellant.\" (Emphasis supplied) 31. In Abhay Jain vs. High Court of Rajasthan2, this Court quoted with approval the observations in Sadhna Chaudhary (supra). 2 (2022) 13 SCC 1\n\n[2026] 1 S.C.R. 107 Nirbhay Singh Suliya v. State of Madhya Pradesh & Anr. 32. When false allegations fly thick and fast, the judicial officers cannot react. Here is where the High Court which is vested with the supervisory control has to exercise great caution and circumspection. As to what the parameters are, when the High Court on the Administrative side is faced with such a scenario, has been felicitously set out by Chief Justice D.Y. Chandrachud J. speaking for the Court in R.R. Parekh v. High Court of Gujarat and Another3 as under: - \"16. The issue of whether a judicial officer has been actuated by an oblique motive or corrupt practice has to be determined upon a careful appraisal of the material on the record. Direct evidence of corruption may not always be forthcoming in every case involving a misconduct of this nature. A wanton breach of the governing principles of law or procedure may well be indicative in a given case of a motivated, if not reckless disregard of legal principle. In the absence of a cogent explanation to the contrary, it is for the disciplinary authority to determine whether a pattern has emerged on the basis of which an inference that the judicial officer was actuated by extraneous considerations can be drawn. Cases involving misdemeanours of a judicial officer have to be dealt with sensitivity and care. A robust common sense must guide the disciplinary authority. At one end of the spectrum are those cases where direct evidence of a misdemeanour is available. Evidence in regard to the existence of an incriminating trail must be carefully scrutinised to determine whether an act of misconduct is established on the basis of legally acceptable evidence. Yet in other cases, direct evidence of a decision being actuated by a corrupt motive may not be available. The issue which arises in such cases is whether there are circumstances from which an inference that extraneous considerations have actuated a judicial officer can legitimately be drawn. Such an inference cannot obviously be drawn merely from a hypothesis that a decision is erroneous. A wrong decision can yet be a bona fide error of judgment. Inadvertence is consistent with an honest error of 3 (2016) 14 SCC 1 108 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports judgment. A charge of misconduct against a judicial officer must be distinguished from a purely erroneous decision whether on law or on fact. The legality of a judicial determination is subject to such remedies as are provided in law for testing the correctness of the determination. It is not the correctness of the verdict but the conduct of the officer which is in question. The disciplinary authority has to determine whether there has emerged from the record one or more circumstances that indicate that the decision which forms the basis of the charge of misconduct was not an honest exercise of judicial power. The circumstances let into evidence to establish misconduct have to be sifted and evaluated with caution. The threat of disciplinary proceedings must not demotivate the honest and independent officer. Yet on the other hand, there is a vital element of accountability to society involved in dealing with cases of misconduct. There is on the one hand a genuine public interest in protecting fearless and honest officers of the District Judiciary from motivated criticism and attack. Equally there is a genuine public interest in holding a person who is guilty of wrongdoing, responsible for his or her actions. Neither aspect of public interest can be ignored. Both are vital to the preservation of the integrity of the administration of justice.\" (Emphasis supplied) 33. As held in R.R. Parekh (supra), it should be borne-in-mind that inference of misconduct or about extraneous considerations having actuated, the decision cannot be drawn merely from a hypothesis that a decision is erroneous. It has been held that a wrong decision can yet be a bona fide error of judgment and inadvertence is consistent with an honest error of judgment. Ultimately, it is not the correctness of the verdict but the conduct of the Officer in question which is determinative. 34. It is apposite to recall the observations of this Court in Union of India and Others vs. K.K. Dhawan4, which has been followed in 4 (1993) 2 SCC 56\n\n[2026] 1 S.C.R. 109 Nirbhay Singh Suliya v. State of Madhya Pradesh & Anr. P.C. Joshi v. State of U.P. and Others5. This Court in K.K. Dhawan (supra), while illustrating certain cases for which disciplinary action can be initiated, took care to administer a note of caution also. In K.K. Dhawan (supra), this Court held:- \"28. Certainly, therefore, the officer who exercises judicial or quasi-judicial powers acts negligently or recklessly or in order to confer undue favour on a person is not acting as a Judge. Accordingly, the contention of the respondent has to be rejected. It is important to bear in mind that in the present case, we are not concerned with the correctness or legality of the decision of the respondent but the conduct of the respondent in discharge of his duties as an officer. The legality of the orders with reference to the nine assessments may be questioned in appeal or revision under the Act. But we have no doubt in our mind that the Government is not precluded from taking the disciplinary action for violation of the Conduct Rules. Thus, we conclude that the disciplinary action can be taken in the following cases: (i) Where the officer had acted in a manner as would reflect on his reputation for integrity or good faith or devotion to duty; (ii) if there is prima facie material to show recklessness or misconduct in the discharge of his duty; (iii) if he has acted in a manner which is unbecoming of a Government servant; (iv) if he had acted negligently or that he omitted the prescribed conditions which are essential for the exercise of the statutory powers; (v) if he had acted in order to unduly favour a party; (vi) if he had been actuated by corrupt motive, however small the bribe may be because Lord Coke said long ago \"though the bribe may be small, yet the fault is great\". 29. The instances above catalogued are not exhaustive. However, we may add that for a mere technical violation 5 (2001) 6 SCC 491 110 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports or merely because the order is wrong and the action not falling under the above enumerated instances, disciplinary action is not warranted. Here, we may utter a word of caution. Each case will depend upon the facts and no absolute rule can be postulated.\" 35. This Court held that merely because the order is wrong, disciplinary action is not warranted and that each case will depend upon the facts and no absolute rule can be postulated. What is significant to notice is that even though in the illustrated case [para 28 (iv)] K.K. Dhawan (supra), cases of omission of prescribed conditions which are essential for the exercise of statutory powers may in a given case furnish a ground for disciplinary enquiry, it is not an absolute rule and each case will depend upon the facts. As observed in R.R. Parekh (supra), the Disciplinary Authority has to examine whether there has emerged from the record, one or more circumstances that indicate that the decision which forms the basis of the charge of misconduct was not an honest exercise of judicial power. 36. In Ishwar Chand Jain v. High Court of Punjab and Haryana and Another6, this Court highlighted how the functioning of the Trial Judiciary would be seriously impacted and fearless discharge of duties would become a casualty, if inquiries are launched on ill-conceived or motivated complaints. This Court in Ishwar Chand Jain (supra) held as under:- \"14. Under the Constitution the High Court has control over the subordinate judiciary. While exercising that control it is under a constitutional obligation to guide and protect judicial officers. An honest strict judicial officer is likely to have adversaries in the mofussil courts. If complaints are entertained on trifling matters relating to judicial orders which may have been upheld by the High Court on the judicial side no judicial officer would feel protected and it would be difficult for him to discharge his duties in an honest and independent manner. An independent and honest judiciary is a sine qua non for rule of law. If judicial officers are under constant threat of complaint and enquiry on trifling 6 (1988) 3 SCC 370\n\n[2026] 1 S.C.R. 111 Nirbhay Singh Suliya v. State of Madhya Pradesh & Anr. matters and if High Court encourages anonymous complaints to hold the field the subordinate judiciary will not be able to administer justice in an independent and honest manner. It is therefore imperative that the High Court should also take steps to protect its honest officers by ignoring ill-conceived or motivated complaints made by the unscrupulous lawyers and litigants. Having regard to facts and circumstances of the instant case we have no doubt in our mind that the resolution passed by the Bar Association against the appellant was wholly unjustified and the complaints made by Shri Mehlawat and others were motivated which did not deserve any credit. Even the vigilance Judge after holding enquiry did not record any finding that the appellant was guilty of any corrupt motive or that he had not acted judicially. All that was said against him was that he had acted improperly in granting adjournments.\" [Emphasis supplied] 37. Similar sentiments were expressed in Ramesh Chander Singh v. High Court of Allahabad and Another7, wherein this Court held as under:- \"12. This Court on several occasions has disapproved the practice of initiation of disciplinary proceedings against officers of the subordinate judiciary merely because the judgments/orders passed by them are wrong. The appellate and revisional courts have been established and given powers to set aside such orders. The higher courts after hearing the appeal may modify or set aside erroneous judgments of the lower courts. While taking disciplinary action based on judicial orders, the High Court must take extra care and caution. 17. In Zunjarrao Bhikaji Nagarkar v. Union of India [(1999) 7 SCC 409 : 1999 SCC (L&S) 1299 : AIR 1999 SC 2881] this Court held that wrong exercise of jurisdiction by a quasi-judicial authority or mistake 7 (2007) 4 SCC 247 112 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports of law or wrong interpretation of law cannot be the basis for initiating disciplinary proceeding. Of course, if the judicial officer conducted in a manner as would reflect on his reputation or integrity or good faith or there is a prima facie material to show recklessness or misconduct in discharge of his duties or he had acted in a manner to unduly favour a party or had passed an order actuated by corrupt motive, the High Court by virtue of its power under Article 235 of the Constitution may exercise its supervisory jurisdiction. Nevertheless, under such circumstances it should be kept in mind that the Judges at all levels have to administer justice without fear or favour. Fearlessness and maintenance of judicial independence are very essential for an efficacious judicial system. Making adverse comments against subordinate judicial officers and subjecting them to severe disciplinary proceedings would ultimately harm the judicial system at the grassroot level.\" 38. Highlighting various options available before the High Court to deal with judicial officers and the need for clearly establishing misconduct and extraneous influences or illegal gratification before resorting to disciplinary measures, this Court in Krishna Prasad Verma v. State of Bihar and Others8, had the following to say:- \"16. We would, however, like to make it clear that we are in no manner indicating that if a judicial officer passes a wrong order, then no action is to be taken. In case a judicial officer passes orders which are against settled legal norms but there is no allegation of any extraneous influences leading to the passing of such orders then the appropriate action which the High Court should take is to record such material on the administrative side and place it on the service record of the judicial officer concerned. These matters can be taken into consideration while considering career progression of the judicial officer concerned. Once note of the wrong order is taken and they form part of the service record these can be taken into consideration to 8 (2019) 10 SCC 640\n\n[2026] 1 S.C.R. 113 Nirbhay Singh Suliya v. State of Madhya Pradesh & Anr. deny selection grade, promotion, etc., and in case there is a continuous flow of wrong or illegal orders then the proper action would be to compulsorily retire the judicial officer, in accordance with the Rules. We again reiterate that unless there are clear-cut allegations of misconduct, extraneous influences, gratification of any kind, etc., disciplinary proceedings should not be initiated merely on the basis that a wrong order has been passed by the judicial officer or merely on the ground that the judicial order is incorrect.\" [Emphasis supplied] 39. That merely because a different conclusion was possible is not an indicium for misconduct was highlighted in P.C. Joshi (supra). \"7. In the present case, though elaborate enquiry has been conducted by the enquiry officer, there is hardly any material worth the name forthcoming except to scrutinize each one of the orders made by the appellant on the judicial side to arrive at a different conclusion. That there was possibility on a given set of facts to arrive at a different conclusion is no ground to indict a judicial officer for taking one view and that too for alleged misconduct for that reason alone. The enquiry officer has not found any other material, which would reflect on his reputation or integrity or good faith or devotion to duty or that he has been actuated by any corrupt motive. At best, he may say that the view taken by the appellant is not proper or correct and not attribute any motive to him which is for extraneous consideration that he had acted in that manner. If in every case where an order of a subordinate court is found to be faulty a disciplinary action were to be initiated, the confidence of the subordinate judiciary will be shaken and the officers will be in constant fear of writing a judgment so as not to face a disciplinary enquiry and thus judicial officers cannot act independently or fearlessly. Indeed the words of caution are given in K.K. Dhawan case [(1993) 2 SCC 56 : 1993 SCC (L&S) 325 : (1993) 24 ATC 1] and A.N. Saxena case [(1992) 3 SCC 124 : 1992 SCC (L&S) 861 : (1992) 21 ATC 670] that merely because the 114 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports order is wrong or the action taken could have been different does not warrant initiation of disciplinary proceedings against the judicial officer. In spite of such caution, it is unfortunate that the High Court has chosen to initiate disciplinary proceedings against the appellant in this case.\" 40. Applying the above principles to the facts of the present case, we find that the appellant has been held guilty of misconduct only based on certain judicial orders granting bail without anything more. We say so for the following reasons:- (i) The complaint, as originally filed by Jaipal Mehta, was primarily against Anil Joshi, the stenographer who has been working in Khargone for a long time even before the appellant assumed office in Khargone. (ii) The complaint neither set out any particulars nor set out any judicial order. It was general in nature. (iii) The complainant was not examined in the inquiry. The witnesses examined in support of the charge Gendalal Chauhan did not support the charge. (iv) The prosecutor who appeared in each of the 18 bail orders was examined on behalf of the defence and even he deposed that the State accepted the orders granting bail without mounting any challenge in the higher court. He categorically deposed that the orders were absolutely proper and were passed on proper grounds. (v) A perusal of the four orders show that reasons have been given, though there is no express mention Section 59-A (2) of the Excise Act. In one bail order, the appellant mentions about the filing of the challan and the possibility of the trial consuming lot of time. In fact, in the said order, the appellant has relied on Article 21 though he has not expressly mentioned the same. In the other bail orders, he mentions about the applicants being rural farmers and not being a flight risk and so on. (vi) There is absolutely no material placed on record to show that there are circumstances from which inference could be drawn that extraneous considerations actuated the passing of those orders of bail. The hypothesis was drawn only on the basis that the order did not make reference to the statutory provision expressly.\n\n[2026] 1 S.C.R. 115 Nirbhay Singh Suliya v. State of Madhya Pradesh & Anr. (vii) The finding that in 14 other orders he referred to Section 59-A (2) of the Excise Act is by itself not enough to infer misconduct in the passing of the four bail orders in question. (viii) It will be a dangerous proposition to hold that judgments and orders which do not refer expressly to statutory provisions are per se dis-honest judgments. 41. The High Court has erred in not interfering with the order. A valiant attempt was made by Mr. Arjun Garg to sustain the impugned order by contending that a writ court or this Court cannot act as an appellate court over the inquiry report and the only consideration was whether the inquiry had been fairly conducted. We are unable to accept the said contention. In our opinion, for the reasons stated above, the findings in the inquiry report are perverse and are not supported by findings on record. We make bold to record a finding that on the available material, no reasonable person would have reached the conclusion that enquiry officer reached. 42. In Yoginath D. Bagde v. State of Maharashtra and Another9, Saghir Ahmad, J. lucidly explained the principle thus:- \"51. It was lastly contended by Mr Harish N. Salve that this Court cannot reappraise the evidence which has already been scrutinised by the enquiry officer as also by the Disciplinary Committee. It is contended that the High Court or this Court cannot, in exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 226 or Article 32 of the Constitution, act as the appellate authority in the domestic enquiry or trial and it is not open to this Court to reappraise the evidence. The proposition as put forward by Mr Salve is in very broad terms and cannot be accepted. The law is well settled that if the findings are perverse and are not supported by evidence on record or the findings recorded at the domestic trial are such to which no reasonable person would have reached, it would be open to the High Court as also to this Court to interfere in the matter. In Kuldeep Singh v. Commr. of Police [(1999) 2 SCC 10 : 1999 SCC (L&S) 429 : JT (1998) 8 SC 603] this Court, 9 (1999) 7 SCC 739 116 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports relying upon the earlier decisions in Nand Kishore Prasad v. State of Bihar [(1978) 3 SCC 366 : 1978 SCC (L&S) 458 : AIR 1978 SC 1277 : (1978) 3 SCR 708] , State of Andhra Pradesh v. Rama Rao [AIR 1963 SC 1723 : (1964) 3 SCR 25] , Central Bank of India Ltd. v. Prakash Chand Jain [AIR 1969 SC 983 : (1969) 2 LLJ 377] , Bharat Iron Works v. Bhagubhai Balubhai Patel [(1976) 1 SCC 518 : 1976 SCC (L&S) 92 : AIR 1976 SC 98 : (1976) 2 SCR 280] as also Rajinder Kumar Kindra v. Delhi Admn. [(1984) 4 SCC 635 : 1985 SCC (L&S) 131 : AIR 1984 SC 1805 : (1985) 1 SCR 866] laid down that although the court cannot sit in appeal over the findings recorded by the disciplinary authority or the enquiry officer in a departmental enquiry, it does not mean that in no circumstance can the court interfere. It was observed that the power of judicial review available to a High Court as also to this Court under the Constitution takes in its stride the domestic enquiry as well and the courts can interfere with the conclusions reached therein if there was no evidence to support the findings or the findings recorded were such as could not have been reached by an ordinary prudent man or the findings were perverse.\" (Emphasis supplied) 43. For the above reasons, the appeal is allowed. The order of removal dated 02.09.2015, the order of Appellate Authority dated 17.03.2016 and the impugned order of the High Court are all set aside. The appellant shall be deemed to have continued in service till he attained the normal age of superannuation. Since the appellant has been kept out of service for no fault of his, we are of the opinion that full back wages with all consequential benefits should be given to the appellant. Let the monetary benefits be released within a period of eight weeks from today with interest @ 6 per cent. No order as to costs. 44. Let a copy of this judgment be transmitted to all the Registrar Generals of the respective High Courts in the country, so as to enable them to draw the attention of the Chief Justices of the High Courts to the same. [2026] 1 S.C.R. 117 Nirbhay Singh Suliya v. State of Madhya Pradesh & Anr. Judgment J.B. Pardiwala, J. 1. My esteemed brother Justice K.V. Viswanathan has penned an ineffable judgment. This judgment will go a long way in protecting judicial officers of the district judiciary from being subjected to departmental action for alleged wrong or incorrect exercise of discretion in passing orders of bail without anything more. Brother Viswanathan has put it very pithily, saying that if the complaint of misconduct against the judicial officer is prima facie found to be true then, in such circumstances, disciplinary proceedings must be taken, and no leniency should be shown if the charges are established. In an appropriate case, even criminal prosecution may be instituted against a judicial officer. Such action is necessary to weed out tainted judges from the judiciary. It goes without saying that corruption in the judiciary at any level is intolerable, as corruption severely undermines the core of the administration of justice and erodes public trust in the rule of law. However, the High Court, which is vested with the supervisory control must keep in mind that a judicial officer of the district judiciary works mostly in a charged atmosphere. A mere wrong order or wrong exercise of discretion in grant of bail by itself without anything more, cannot be a ground to initiate departmental proceedings. 2. Initiation of departmental proceedings on mere suspicion is one of the primary causes why trial court judges are reluctant when it comes to exercising discretion for the purpose of grant of bail. It should not happen that because of the lurking fear in the mind of a trial court judge, of some administrative action being taken that even in a deserving case, well within the principles of law, bail is declined. This is one reason why the High Courts are flooded with bail applications. The same is the scenario even so far as the Supreme Court is concerned. Over a period of time, the trial court judges have exhibited tendency to shirk from their solemn judicial function and responsibility when it comes to exercising discretion in matters relating to bail. Courts of the district judiciary wield powers necessary for the functioning of the justice delivery system in India and when their autonomy is compromised by higher courts and fear takes precedence over judicial duties, democracy and the rule of law suffer.\n\n118 [2026] 1 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports 3. For functioning of democracy, an independent judiciary to dispense justice without fear and favour is paramount. As held by this Court in M.S. Bindra versus Union reported in (1998) 7 SCC 310 while evaluating the materials the authority should not altogether ignore the reputation in which the officer was held till recently. The maxim \"Nemo Firut Repente Turpissimus\" (no one becomes dishonest all of a sudden) is not unexceptional but still is a salutary guideline to judge human conduct, particularly in the field of Administrative Law. The authorities should not keep the eyes totally closed towards the overall estimation in which the delinquent officer was held in the recent past by those who were supervising him earlier. To dunk an officer into the puddle of \"doubtful integrity\" it is not enough that the doubt fringes on a mere hunch. That doubt should be of such a nature as would reasonably and consciously be entertainable by a reasonable man on the given material. Mere possibility is hardly sufficient to assume that it would have happened. There must be preponderance of probability for the reasonable man to entertain doubt regarding that possibility. Only then there is justification to ram an officer with the label 'doubtful integrity'.

K. Verma, Ms. Rakshanda Pande, Saurabh Upadhyay, Ms. Hardikaa Kalia, Gaurav Kandpal, Manish Chaurasia, Vinay Kumar Singh. Adv. for the Respondent(s): Ms. Farhat Jahan Rehmani. Judgment / Order of the Supreme Court Judgment Vikram Nath, J. 1. Leave granted. 2. The present appeal is directed against the interim order dated 18th July, 2025, passed by High Court of Uttarakhand at Nainital1 in Special Appeal No. 192 of 2025, whereby the High Court stayed the operation of the judgment dated 11th July, 2025, rendered by the learned Single Judge in Writ Petition (MS) No. 2083 of 2025 and further directed the Returning Officer to allot a symbol to respondent No. 1 (the writ petitioner) and permit him to participate in the election to the office of Zila Panchayat Member. 3. The brief facts, in a nutshell, insofar as they are relevant for the disposal of the present appeal, are as follows: 3.1. The Uttarakhand State Election Commission issued a revised notification dated 28th June, 2026, thereby resuming the Panchayat elections in twelve districts of the State. Pursuant thereto, respondent No. 1 submitted his nomination for election to the post of Zila Panchayat Member from Constituency No. 11- Bharhgaon, District Pithoragarh. 1 Hereinafter, referred to as \"High Court\".\n\n260 [2026] 2 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports 3.2. Subsequently, the appellant raised an objection alleging failure on the part of respondent No. 1 to make the requisite disclosures. Upon consideration thereof, the Returning Officer, vide order dated 9th July, 2025, cancelled the candidature of respondent No. 1. 3.3. Aggrieved by the said action, respondent No. 1 approached the High Court by filing Writ Petition (MS) No. 2083 of 2025. The learned Single Judge, vide order dated 11th July, 2025, dismissed the writ petition, observing that in view of the election process having already been set in motion, the writ petition was not liable to be entertained at that stage. On the very same date, namely 11th July, 2025, the present appellant was declared elected unopposed to the office of Zila Panchayat Member, the remaining two candidates, including respondent No. 1, having been declared disqualified by the Election Officer. 3.4. In the meantime, respondent No. 1 preferred an intra-court appeal, being Special Appeal No. 192 of 2025, without impleading the present appellant as a party. The learned Division Bench, vide the impugned interim order, stayed the operation of the judgment rendered by the learned Single Judge and directed the Returning Officer to allot a symbol to respondent No. 1 (the writ petitioner) and to permit him to participate in the election to the office of Zila Panchayat Member. 4. Therefore, the appellant is before this Court. 5. This Court, vide order dated 23rd July, 2025, issued notice to the respondents and stayed the operation of the interim order dated 18th July, 2025, passed by the High Court. It was further clarified that the election process would continue in accordance with law, and that the result thereof would remain subject to the final outcome of the present appeal. 6. Finally, when the matter was taken up for hearing on 12th January, 2026, learned counsel for respondent No. 1, who had earlier entered appearance, was not present. As per the office report, respondents Nos. 2 to 5 were reported to be unserved. However, since the said respondents are only pro-forma parties, we proceeded to hear learned counsel appearing for the appellant and reserved judgment on the same day. [2026] 2 S.C.R. 261 Sandeep Singh Bora v. Narendra Singh Deopa & Ors. 7. We have heard the learned counsel appearing for the appellant and have carefully perused the material available on record. 8. At the outset, we are unable to concur with the view taken by the Division Bench of the High Court and, for the reasons that shall be delineated hereinafter, are inclined to set aside the same. 8.1. The learned Single Judge, while dismissing the writ petition instituted by respondent No. 1, assigned the following reasons: - a. That Article 243-O of the Constitution of India2 contains an express bar, stipulating that no election to any Panchayat shall be called in question except by way of an election petition, to be governed by the law enacted by the Legislature of the concerned State. b. That Section 131H of the Uttarakhand Panchayati Raj Act, 20163 provides an efficacious alternative remedy by way of an election petition in cases of improper rejection of nomination, and therefore, at that stage, the writ petition before the High Court was not maintainable. 8.2. In the intra-court appeal preferred by respondent No. 1, the Division Bench, by the impugned interim order, stayed the operation of the order dated 11th July, 2025, passed by the learned Single Judge and directed the Returning Officer to allot a symbol to respondent No. 1 (the writ petitioner therein) and permit him to participate in the election process for the office of Zila Panchayat Member. In arriving at this conclusion, the Division Bench assigned the following reasons: - a. That the bar contained in Article 243-O of the Constitution was held to be inapplicable to the present case, as the challenge was not directed against the election of any candidate, but was confined to the alleged illegal rejection of the nomination of respondent No. 1, for which, according to the Division Bench, no efficacious alternative remedy was available. 2 Hereinafter, referred to as \"Constitution\". 3 Hereinafter, referred to as \"Panchayati Raj Act\".\n\n262 [2026] 2 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports b. That Section 90 of the Panchayati Raj Act enumerates the circumstances and grounds attracting disqualification for the office of Zila Panchayat Member, and in the facts of the present case, the alleged non-disclosure of an acquittal in a prior criminal case did not fall within any of the disqualifications so specified. 9. In our considered view, the Division Bench transgressed the limits of its jurisdiction in interfering with the electoral process, in disregard of the settled position of law. The election jurisprudence in this country has undergone a significant evolution. With a view to maintaining a delicate balance between decisions rendered by statutory authorities and judicial intervention by way of judicial review, a stage was reached where Parliament considered it appropriate to accord constitutional status to the Panchayati Raj institutions. 9.1. Accordingly, Part IX, titled \"The Panchayats\", was inserted into the Constitution by the Constitution (73rd Amendment) Act, 1992. The said constitutional amendment gives effect to Article 40 of the Directive Principles of State Policy, which enjoins the State to take steps to organise village panchayats and to endow them with such powers and authority as may be necessary to enable them to function as units of self-government. By virtue of this amendment, the Panchayati Raj institutions were elevated from a non-justiciable to a constitutionally enforceable framework. At the same time, the States were accorded sufficient latitude to structure and implement the Panchayati Raj system having due regard to their distinct geographical, political, administrative and other local conditions. 9.2. Article 243-O of the Constitution, introduced by the aforesaid constitutional amendment, places an express embargo on judicial interference in matters relating to elections to the Panchayats. The provision reads as follows: - 243O. Bar to interference by courts in electoral matters.- Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution- (a) the validity of any law relating to the delimitation of constituencies or the allotment of seats to such [2026] 2 S.C.R. 263 Sandeep Singh Bora v. Narendra Singh Deopa & Ors. constituencies, made or purporting to be made under article 243K, shall not be called in question in any court; (b) no election to any Panchayat shall be called in question except by an election petition presented to such authority and in such manner as is provided for by or under any law made by the Legislature of a State. (emphasis supplied) Therefore, Article 243-O(b) of the Constitution makes it abundantly clear that no election to any Panchayat can be called in question except by way of an election petition presented to such authority and in such manner as may be provided by the State Legislature. 9.3. This Court, in Harnek Singh v. Charanjit Singh,4 while examining the object and purpose underlying the incorporation of the bar contained in Article 243-O of the Constitution, also considered the said provision in juxtaposition with the plenary jurisdiction of the High Courts under Article 226. The Court observed as follows: \"15. Prayers (b) and (c) aforementioned, evidently, could not have been granted in favour of the petitioner by the High Court in exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution. It is true that the High Court exercises a plenary jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution. Such jurisdiction being discretionary in nature may not be exercised inter alia keeping in view the fact that an efficacious alternative remedy is available therefor. (See Sanjana M. Wig v. Hindustan Petroleum Corpn. Ltd. [(2005) 8 SCC 242 : (2005) 7 Scale 290] ) 16. Article 243-O of the Constitution mandates that all election disputes must be determined 4 (2005) 8 SCC 383\n\n264 [2026] 2 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports only by way of an election petition. This by itself may not per se bar judicial review which is the basic structure of the Constitution, but ordinarily such jurisdiction would not be exercised. There may be some cases where a writ petition would be entertained but in this case we are not concerned with the said question. 17. In C. Subrahmanyam [(1998) 8 SCC 703] a three-Judge Bench of this Court observed that a writ petition should not be entertained when the main question which fell for decision before the High Court was non-compliance with the provisions of the Act which was one of the grounds for an election petition in terms of Rule 12 framed under the Act.\" (emphasis supplied) Thus, it is evident that where a specific statutory remedy is available by way of an election petition, the High Court must exercise great circumspection and restraint in invoking its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution. The need for such judicial restraint is further reinforced by the non-obstante clause with which Article 243-O opens, namely, the expression \"Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution\". 9.4. Article 243-O(b), thus, places a bar on the exercise of jurisdiction by Courts under the Constitution in matters relating to elections to Panchayats, where a law has been enacted by the Legislature of a State providing for such elections. The existence of a law made by the State Legislature is a condition precedent for the operation of the embargo contemplated under Article 243-O. The provision does not abrogate the sacrosanct power of judicial review, which forms part of the basic structure of the Constitution; rather, it channels such review through a statutorily prescribed and efficacious mechanism, namely, an election petition to be presented before the authority designated under the law enacted by the State Legislature for that purpose. [2026] 2 S.C.R. 265 Sandeep Singh Bora v. Narendra Singh Deopa & Ors. 10. In the present case, the State of Uttarakhand has enacted the Uttarakhand Panchayati Raj Act, 2016. Consequently, the bar envisaged under Article 243-O of the Constitution stands attracted. Therefore, if respondent No. 1 was aggrieved by the order dated 9th July, 2025, passed by the Election Officer rejecting his nomination, the appropriate remedy lay within the framework of the Panchayati Raj Act itself. At this stage, it would be apposite to advert to Section 131H of the Panchayati Raj Act, being the statutory provision which directly governs the issue at hand. The said provision is reproduced hereinbelow: - \"131H. Application regarding election and their revision.- (1) The election of a person as Pradhan or Up-Pradhan or as member of a Gram Panchayat shall not be called in question except by an application presented to such authority within such time and in such manner as may be prescribed, on the ground:- (a) that this election has not been free election by reason that the corrupt practice of bribery or undue influence has extensively prevailed at the election; or (b) that the result of the election has been materially affected- (i) by the acceptance or rejection of any nomination in improper manner; or (ii) by gross failure to comply with the provisions of this Act or the rules framed there under. (2) . . . (3) The application under sub-section (1) may be presented by any candidate at the election or any elector and shall contain such particulars as may be prescribed; Explanation:- Any person, who filed a nomination paper at the election whether such nomination paper was accepted or rejected, shall be deemed to be a candidate at the election.\n\n266 [2026] 2 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports (5) Without prejudice to the generality of the powers to be prescribed under sub-section (4) the rules may be provided for summarily hearing and disposal of an application under subsection (1). (6) Any party aggrieved by an order of the prescribed authority who shall be Assistant Collector (first class)/ Pargana Magistrate of concerned Tehsil/ Pargana upon an application under subsection (1) may, within thirty days from the date of the order, apply to the District Judge for revision of such order or any one or more on the following grounds; namely: - (a) that the prescribed authority has exercised such jurisdiction not vested in it by law; (b) that the prescribed authority has failed to exercise a such jurisdiction so vested; (c) that the prescribed authority has acted in the exercise of its jurisdiction illegally or with material irregularity. (7) The District Judge may dispose of the application for revision himself or may assign it for disposal to any Additional District Judge, Civil Judge or Additional Civil Judge under his administrative control and may recall it from any such officer or transfer it to any other such officer.\" (emphasis supplied) 10.1. Section 131H specifically governs disputes relating to the election of a Pradhan, Up-Pradhan or a Member of a Gram Panchayat. The provision, being couched in negative terms, warrants heightened judicial circumspection while entertaining proceedings contrary to its mandate. It expressly stipulates that no election shall be called in question except by an application presented before the prescribed authority, within such time and in such manner as may be laid down. 10.2. Sub-section (1)(b) of Section 131H of the Panchayati Raj Act contemplates a situation where the result of an election has been materially affected by the improper acceptance or rejection of a nomination. It is the specific case of respondent No. 1 in the writ petition that the Election Officer rejected [2026] 2 S.C.R. 267 Sandeep Singh Bora v. Narendra Singh Deopa & Ors. his candidature on a ground which, according to him, is not contemplated under Section 90 of the Panchayati Raj Act, the provision which enumerates the disqualifications for membership of a Zila Panchayat. 10.3. Therefore, if, according to respondent No. 1, there was a specific infraction of the statutory provisions by the Election Officer, the remedy availed by him was also required to be in consonance with the scheme of the very statute. It would thus not be permissible for respondent No. 1 to seek enforcement of compliance with the provisions of the Panchayati Raj Act by the authorities conducting the election, while at the same time electing to bypass the statutorily prescribed remedy available under the said enactment. 10.4. Sub-section (6) of Section 131H of the Panchayati Raj Act explicitly stipulates that the prescribed authority before whom an election petition is to be presented shall be an Assistant Collector (First Class) or a Pargana Magistrate. In view of the comprehensive statutory framework providing both the forum and the procedure for redressal of grievances arising out of non-compliance with the provisions of the Act, we find ourselves unable to concur with the undue haste with which the Division Bench proceeded to deal with the matter at hand. 10.5. A three-Judge Bench of this Court, in Laxmibai v. Collector,5 cited with approval the decision in N.P. Ponnuswami v. Returning Officer, Namakkal Constituency,6 wherein it was held that in cases of rejection of a nomination, the sole remedy available is by way of an election petition to be presented after the conclusion of the election process, and that even the High Court lacks jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution during the interregnum. The Court categorically observed that the ground of rejection of a nomination paper cannot be agitated in any other manner, at any other stage, or before any other forum. 11. In the present case, the appellant had already been declared elected unopposed on 11th July, 2025 since the remaining two candidates, including respondent No. 1, had been declared disqualified by the 5 (2020) 12 SCC 186 6 (1952) 1 SCC 9\n\n268 [2026] 2 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports competent authorities. The High Court, therefore, committed a manifest error in interfering in exercise of its extraordinary jurisdiction on three counts. First, the High Court acted in the teeth of the constitutional embargo contained in Article 243-O of the Constitution. Second, by directing the Returning Officer to allot a symbol to respondent No. 1 and permitting him to participate in the election process, the High Court issued directions contrary to a process which had already attained finality with the appellant having been declared elected unopposed. Lastly, the High Court proceeded to stay the order of the learned Single Judge dismissing the writ petition filed by respondent No. 1, without affording an opportunity of hearing to the appellant, who stood directly and adversely affected by such directions, having already been elected to the post in question. 12. In view of the foregoing discussion, we summarise our conclusions as under: - I. By virtue of the express constitutional embargo contained in Article 243-O of the Constitution of India, the High Court is precluded from exercising jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution where a law enacted by the State Legislature provides for the remedy of an election petition to redress grievances arising during the course of an election. II. The election process cannot be lightly interdicted or stalled at the behest of an individual grievance. The right to contest or question an election being statutory in nature, must be strictly construed and exercised in accordance with the statute governing the field. The High Court must, therefore, eschew the grant of liberal interim reliefs in favour of individuals and instead remain mindful of the overarching public interest in ensuring the smooth and uninterrupted conduct of elections across the State. III. In respect of individual grievances, the ultimate and exclusive remedy lies by way of an election petition. Given the non- obstante nature of Article 243-O of the Constitution, its mandate is required to be adhered to in both letter and spirit. Where the statute provides a complete and efficacious mechanism for redressal, the extraordinary exercise of jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution would defeat the very object for which Article 243-O was enacted as a non-obstante provision. [2026] 2 S.C.R. 269 Sandeep Singh Bora v. Narendra Singh Deopa & Ors. 13. Accordingly, the interim order dated 18th July, 2025, passed by the High Court of Uttarakhand at Nainital in Special Appeal No. 192 of 2025 is set aside, and the writ appeal stands dismissed. 14. Consequently, the present appeal stands allowed. 15. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of. Result of the case: Appeal allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan", "2026_2_270_284_EN_2026": "[2026] 2 S.C.R. 270 : 2026 INSC 106 Rajia Begum v.

Headnotes† Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 - Impact of fraud on arbitrability of a dispute - Present appeals arise from a partnership dispute in which Respondent no.1 (in CA No.675 of 2026) claimed entry into the firm relying on an Admission Deed, and as foundation of arbitration agreement, whose execution is denied and is alleged to be forged by the Appellant therein - High Court on the same factual foundation involving the same alleged arbitration agreement, has in one proceeding directed the parties to resolve their disputes through arbitration and in another proceeding, declined to appoint an arbitrator on the ground, that the existence of the arbitration agreement is itself in serious doubt - Challenge to: Held: When an allegation of fraud is made with regard to arbitration agreement itself, such a dispute is generally recognised as a dispute, which is in the realm of non-arbitrability and the court will examine it, as a jurisdictional issue only to enquire whether the dispute has become non-arbitrable due to one or the other reason - In the present case, admission Deed is not genuine - There exists substantial and cogent material which casts serious doubt * Author\n\n[2026] 2 S.C.R. 271 Rajia Begum v. Barnali Mukherjee on the genuineness of the Admission Deed - Arbitration clause does not exist independently but is embedded in the document whose existence is seriously disputed - The dispute relating to the Admission Deed involves serious allegations going to the root of the arbitration agreement itself and is not amenable to arbitration at this stage - Arbitration is founded upon consent - A party may be bound by the arbitral process only if it is first shown, even at a prima facie level, that such a party had agreed to submit disputes to arbitration - Where the arbitration agreement itself is alleged to be forged or fabricated, the disputes cease to be merely contractual and strikes at the very root of arbitral jurisdiction - A controversy of this nature falls squarely within the category of disputes that are generally recognized as non-arbitrable - Order passed by the High Court allowing the respondent no.1's application u/s.8 of the Act referring the dispute in Suit to be resolved through arbitration is unsustainable and is quashed and set aside - Order of the High Court rejecting the respondent no.1's application u/s.11 of the Act for the appointment of arbitrator warrants no interference and is affirmed. [Paras 15, 16, 20, 24] Fraud - Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 - Impact of fraud on arbitrability of a dispute: Held: Mere allegation of fraud simpliciter may not be a ground to nullify the arbitration agreement between the parties, but where the court finds that there are serious allegations of fraud which make a case of criminal offence or where the allegations of fraud are so complicated, which need to be decided on the basis of voluminous evidence, the court can sidetrack the arbitration agreement and proceed with the suit - Court can proceed with the suit in cases where the fraud is alleged against the arbitration provision itself or is of a such a nature which permeates the entire contract, including the agreement to arbitrate, meaning thereby in those cases where fraud goes to the validity of the contract itself which contains an arbitration clause or the validity of the arbitration clause itself. [Para 12] Constitution of India - Article 227 - Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996: Held: Both the Trial Court and the First Appellate Court had concurrently held that the allegations of fraud in the present case were serious and that the respondent no.1 had failed to 272 [2026] 2 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports produce the original Admission Deed or a certified copy thereof, as required u/s.8(2) of the Act - The aforesaid findings were not perfunctory, but were grounded in the material on record and in the statutory requirements - Supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 227 of the Constitution is not an appellate jurisdiction in disguise, and it does not permit reappreciation of evidence - High Court, while exercising jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution, was not justified in dislodging the concurrent findings and directing reference of the dispute to arbitration, particularly when the very existence of the arbitration agreement was under serious doubt - Conversely, the High Court was correct in dismissing the respondent no.1's application u/s.11 of the 1996 Act - When the existence of the arbitration agreement itself is in serious dispute and requires adjudication, appointment of an arbitrator would be premature and legally impermissible. [Paras 21-23] Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 - s.9 - Appellant (in CA No.675 of 2026), respondent no.2 and respondent no.3, constituted a partnership firm - Respondent no.1 issued notice to the appellant and relied upon an Admission Deed as the source of her induction into the firm and as foundation of arbitration agreement - Appellant denied the execution of the Admission Deed and stated that Admission Deed is a forged and fabricated document - Respondent no.1 applied to the Trial Court u/s.9, 1996 Act, allowed by Trial Court - Appeal filed by the appellant, allowed by High Court - Appeal filed by respondent no.1, dismissed by Supreme Court and the order of the High Court rejecting the application of the respondent no.1 u/s.9 of the Act, attained finality - Appellant filed civil suit inter alia seeking a declaration that the 'Admission Deed' is a forged document; respondent no.1 filed application u/s.8 to refer the suit to arbitration - Application dismissed by Trial Court - Appeal thereagainst also dismissed - Revision filed by respondent no.1 - Allowed by High Court, orders of the Trial Court and First Appellate Court set aside, and the dispute in Suit was referred to be resolved through arbitration - Parallelly, respondent no.1 had filed petition u/s.11 for the appointment of an arbitrator - Dismissed by High Court: Held: Findings in s.9 proceedings are undoubtedly prima facie in nature, such findings, when they attain finality, cannot be ignored [2026] 2 S.C.R. 273 Rajia Begum v.

Judgment / Order of the Supreme Court Judgment Alok Aradhe, J. Leave granted. 2. The present appeals arise from a partnership dispute in which appellant claims entry into the firm by virtue of a document whose execution is stoutly denied and is alleged to be forged. The High Court on the same factual foundation involving the same alleged arbitration agreement, has in one proceeding directed the parties to resolve their disputes through arbitration and whereas in another\n\n[2026] 2 S.C.R. 275 Rajia Begum v. Barnali Mukherjee proceeding, declined to appoint an arbitrator on the ground, that the existence of an arbitration agreement is itself in serious doubt. A common issue namely, whether the disputes can be referred to arbitration or an arbitrator can be appointed when the very existence of arbitration agreement itself is seriously disputed on the allegations of forgery and fabrication, arises for consideration in these appeals. (i) NARRATION OF FACTS 3. The appellant, Barnali Mukherjee, in the appeal @ SLP (C) No. 20262 of 2021 (appellant), Aftabuddin (respondent no.2) and Raihan Ikbal (respondent no.3), constituted a partnership firm styled as 'M/s RDDHI Gold' (firm) by virtue of partnership deed dated 01.12.2005. Rajia Begum (respondent no.1) claims that the respondent nos.2 and 3 executed a power of attorney on 17.04.2007 empowering her to manage the affairs of the firm on their behalf pursuant to which she executed a deed of admission and retirement (Admission Deed) by which respondent nos.2 and 3 retired from the firm. 4. The appellant contends that the business of the reconstituted partnership firm was absorbed and taken over by a company named 'RDDHI Gold Pvt. Ltd.' (company) pursuant to the absorption deed dated 27.02.2011. On 02.10.2016, the respondent no.1 issued a notice to the appellant asserting that, on the basis of the aforesaid Admission Deed dated 17.04.2007, she had acquired an interest to the extent of 50.33% in the erstwhile partnership firm and that respondent nos.2 and 3 had retired as partners in 2007 itself. The appellant by reply dated 21.11.2016, categorically denied the execution of the Admission Deed by her or by the other respondents and further denied the very induction of the respondent no.1 in the firm as a partner at any point in time. Thus, the appellant took a stand that the Admission Deed is a forged and fabricated document, concocted by the respondent no.1. (ii) APLICATION UNDER SECTION 9 OF THE ACT 5. The respondent no.1 applied to the Trial Court under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (Act), for preservation of the subject matter of dispute and for appointment of receiver for the Company which came to be allowed by the Trial Court. The High 276 [2026] 2 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports Court, by an order dated 04.05.2018, allowed the appeal filed by the appellant inter alia finding that the very existence/execution of the 'Admission Deed' is in dispute and, in view of the availability of cogent material which would indicate the non-existence of the Admission Deed, it would not be prudent on the part of the Court exercising jurisdiction under Section 9 of the Act, to accord interim protection to the respondent no.1 who has failed to demonstrate the existence of an arbitration agreement in a prima facie manner. Aggrieved by the order of the High Court dated 04.05.2018, the respondent no.1 preferred an Appeal to this Court which came to be dismissed. Thus, the said order of the High Court dated 04.05.2018, rejecting the application of the respondent no.1 under Section 9 of the Act, attained finality between the parties. (iii) APPLICATION UNDER SECTION 8 OF THE ACT 6. The appellant, on 16.05.2018, filed a civil suit bearing No.71/2018 before the competent civil court seeking the relief of declaration and injunction against the respondent no.1 inter alia seeking a declaration that the 'Admission Deed' is a forged document. The respondent no.1, in the said suit, preferred an application to the Trial Court under Section 8 of the Act, to refer the suit to arbitration, owing to the existence of an arbitration agreement between the parties in respect of disputes concerning the 'Admission Deed'. The said application preferred by the respondent no.1, under Section 8 of the Act, came to be dismissed by the Trial Court vide order dated 06.09.2018 which inter alia held that the allegations of fraud relating to the validity of the impugned Admission Deed were complicated in nature and that the respondent no.1 had failed to produce either the original Admission Deed or a certified copy thereof. 7. The respondent no.1 preferred an appeal against the said Order dated 06.09.2018, before the Additional District Judge, who also dismissed the appeal in terms of the order dated 25.09.2020. Being aggrieved, the respondent no.1 further preferred a revision under Article 227 of the Constitution to the High Court, which by order dated 24.09.2021 set aside the orders of the Trial Court and the First Appellate Court, and allowed the revision filed by the respondent no.1 by referring the dispute in Suit No.71/2018 to be resolved through arbitration. [2026] 2 S.C.R. 277 Rajia Begum v. Barnali Mukherjee (iv) APPLICATION UNDER SECTION 11 OF THE ACT 8. Parallelly, when the aforesaid proceedings under Sections 8 and 9 were ongoing, the respondent no.1 had also filed a petition under Section 11 of the Act before the High Court, seeking appointment of an arbitrator for resolving the disputes between the parties which had arisen in terms of the arbitration clause contained in the 'Admission Deed'. The High Court dismissed the petition filed by the respondent No.1, under Section 11 of the Act, by order dated 11.03.2021, inter alia holding that it would not be expedient to appoint an arbitrator till such time that the issue regarding the existence of an arbitration agreement between the parties has been answered finally. In the appeal @ SLP (c) No.6013 of 2021, the respondent no.1 has challenged the judgment and order dated 11.03.2021 by which her application under Section 11 of the Act has been dismissed. In the appeal @ SLP (C) No.20262 of 2021, the appellant has assailed the judgment dated 24.09.2021 by which petition filed by the respondent no.1 under Article 227 was allowed and the title suit filed by the appellant was referred to arbitration. (v) SUBMISSIONS 9. The learned counsel for respondent no.1 submitted that the observations made by the High Court while deciding an appeal, arising out of an order under Section 9 of the Act, are only for the purposes of deciding the appeal and it has been clarified that the views expressed in the order are tentative and should not prejudice the respondent no.1 in any other proceeding. Alternatively, it is contended that prima facie observation on the existence of arbitration agreement made in an appeal, arising out of an order under Section 9 of the Act, cannot affect the jurisdiction of the Court under Section 11 of the Act. It is urged that the dispute pertains to allegations of fraud challenging the arbitration agreement itself, is arbitrable and well within the jurisdiction of the arbitrator. It is submitted that the High Court, in exercise of supervisory powers under Article 227, has rightly set aside the orders passed by the Trial Court and the Appellate Court. It is, therefore, contended that the dispute be referred to the arbitration by appointing an arbitrator and the order dated 24.09.2021 passed by the High Court under Article 227 be 278 [2026] 2 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports maintained. In support of the aforesaid submissions, reliance has been placed on the decisions of this Court1. 10. On the other hand, learned senior counsel for the appellant submitted that the Admission Deed is forged and fabricated document and there is no privity of contract between the parties. It is submitted that the High Court in its order dated 04.05.2018 has categorically recorded a finding that the Admission Deed is not a genuine document. It is submitted that the material on record does not indicate that the respondent no.1 has acted as a partner since 2007 till date. It is contended that the Admission Deed is a manufactured and a forged document. It is argued that the High Court erred in interfering with the orders passed by the Trial Court and the Appellate Court in exercise of powers under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. In support of the aforesaid submissions, reliance has been placed on the decisions of this Court2. (vi) ISSUE 11. We have bestowed our consideration upon rival submissions and have carefully traversed the record placed before us. The central question which emerges for our determination is whether in the factual matrix of the case, the disputes between the parties could have been referred to the arbitration under Section 8 of the Act and correspondingly whether the High Court was justified in declining the appointment of an arbitrator under Section 11 of the Act. (vii) IMPACT OF FRAUD ON ARBITRABILITY 12. The legal position with regard to the impact of fraud on arbitrability of a dispute under the Act is well delineated by decisions of this Court. A two-Judge Bench of this Court3 held that mere allegation 1 A. Ayyasamy v. A Paramasivam & Others (2016) 10 SCC 386; Rashid Raza v. Sadaf Akhtar (2019) 8 SCC 710; Vidya Drolia & Ors. v. Durga Trading Corporation (2021) 2 SCC 1; N.N. Global Mercantile Pvt. Ltd. v. Indo Unique Flame Ltd. (2021) 4 SCC 379; Avitel Post Studioz Ltd. & Ors. v. HSBC PI Holdings (Mauritius) Ltd. (2021) 4 SCC 713; Sushma Shivkumar Daga & Anr. v. Madhurkumar Ramkrishnaji Bajaj & Ors. (2024) 12 SCC 253; K. Mangayarkarasi & Anr. v. N.J. Sundaresan & Anr. (2025) 8 SCC 299; ITI Ltd. v. Siemens Public Communications Network Ltd. (2002) 5 SCC 510; Nirma Ltd. v. Lurgi Lentjes Energietechnik GMBH (2002) 5 SCC 520; Deep Industries Ltd. v. Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. & Anr. (2020) 15 SCC 706 and Bhaven Construction v. Executive Engineer, Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd. (2022) 1 SCC 75. 2 A. Ayyasamy (supra); Vidya Drolia & Ors. (supra); SBP & Co. v. Patel Engineering Ltd. and Anr. (2005) 8 SCC 618 and Deep Industries Ltd. (supra). 3 A. AYYASAMY v. A. PARAMASIVAM AND OTHERS (supra) [2026] 2 S.C.R. 279 Rajia Begum v. Barnali Mukherjee of fraud simpliciter may not be a ground to nullify the arbitration agreement between the parties, but where the court finds that there are serious allegations of fraud which make a case of criminal offence or where the allegations of fraud are so complicated, which need to be decided on the basis of voluminous evidence, the court can sidetrack the arbitration agreement and proceed with the suit. It has further been held that the court can proceed with the suit in cases where the fraud is alleged against the arbitration provision itself or is of a such a nature which permeates the entire contract, including the agreement to arbitrate, meaning thereby in those cases where fraud goes to the validity of the contract itself which contains an arbitration clause or the validity of the arbitration clause itself. 13. The aforesaid principle was referred to with approval, by another two-Judge Bench of this Court4 and two working tests were laid down for determining serious allegations of fraud, which would render the subject matter of an agreement non-arbitrable namely, (1) does this plea permeate the entire contract and above all, the agreement of arbitration, rendering it void, or (2) whether the allegations of fraud, touch upon the internal affairs of the parties, inter se having no implication in the public domain. It was further held that the first test is satisfied only when it can be said that the arbitration clause or agreement itself cannot be said to exist in a clear case in which the court finds that the party against whom breach is alleged cannot be said to have entered into the agreement relating to arbitration at all. Thus, in a case where plea is taken with regard to non-existence of an arbitration clause or agreement, the same would amount to serious allegation of fraud and would render the subject matter of an agreement non-arbitrable. 14. Recently, a two-Judge Bench of this Court in Managing Director Bihar State Food and Civil Supply Corporation Limited5 (to which one of us P.S. Narasimha, J. was a party) took note of the previous decisions of this Court6 and restated the principles governing 4 AVITEL POST STUDIOZ LIMITED AND OTHERS v. HSBC PI HOLDINGS (MAURITIUS) LTD. (supra) 5 Managing Director Bihar State Food and Civil Supply Corporation Limited and Another v. Sanjay Kumar, 2025 SCC OnLine SC 1604 6 A. Ayyasamy (supra), Lalchand Shah v. Rishabh Enterprises (2018) 15 SCC 678, Rashid Raza v. Sadaf Akhtar (2019) 8 SCC 710 and Avitel Post Studioz Limited And Others (supra)\n\n280 [2026] 2 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports arbitrability in cases involving allegations of serious fraud. The relevant extract of para 21 of the decision in Managing Director (supra) is extracted below:- \"21. In view of our decision, it is unnecessary to delve deep on this issue, but sufficient to restate the law on the subject. The position of law as it applies to initiation of arbitral proceedings in the teeth of allegations of criminality involved in the dispute, where criminal proceedings are either pending or to be initiated is considered in several decisions of this Court. In A. Ayyasamy v. A. Paramasivam, this Court has considered the matter in detail and laid down certain principles. As the relevant portions of the decision in Ayyasamy (supra) have been extracted in the subsequent decisions of this Court in Ameet Lalchand Shah v. Rishabh Enterprises, Rashid Raza v. Sadaf Akhtar, and Avitel Post Studioz Limited v. HSBC PI Holdings (Mauritius) Limited, we are of the opinion that our judgment need not be burdened by extracting excerpts from the judgment all over again. Instead, we seek to restate the principles as follows:-- XXX XXX XXX VI. \"Serious allegations of fraud\" is to be understood in the context of facts. In Rashid Raza (supra) this Court laid down two tests. The first test is satisfied only when it can be said that the arbitration clause or agreement itself cannot be said to exist in a clear case in which the court finds that the party against whom breach is alleged cannot be said to have entered into the agreement relating to arbitration at all. The second test can be said to have been met in cases in which allegations are made against the State or its instrumentalities of arbitrary, fraudulent, or mala fide conduct, thus necessitating the hearing of the case by a writ court in which questions are raised which are not predominantly questions arising from the contract itself or breach thereof, but questions arising in the public law domain. XXX XXX XXX [2026] 2 S.C.R. 281 Rajia Begum v. Barnali Mukherjee IX. However, the allegations of fraud with respect to the arbitration agreement itself stand on a different footing. This position is generally recognized as a dispute which is in the realm of non-arbitrability. In such cases, the arbitral tribunal will not examine the allegation of fraud but will consider the submission only for the purpose of examining exclusion of jurisdiction. This principle, in its application, can be seen in the judgment of this Court in Avitel.\" 15. Thus, it is evident that when an allegation of fraud is made with regard to arbitration agreement itself, such a dispute is generally recognised as a dispute, which is in the realm of non-arbitrability and the court will examine it, as a jurisdictional issue only to enquire whether the dispute has become non-arbitrable due to one or the other reason. (viii) ANALYSIS 16. In the backdrop of the aforesaid well settled legal position, we may advert to the facts of the case in hand. At the heart of the controversy lies the Admission Deed which is relied upon by respondent no.1 as the source of her induction into the firm and as foundation of arbitration agreement. On a prime facie consideration of the material placed on record, we find that there exists substantial and cogent material which casts serious doubt on the genuineness of the Admission Deed. The following circumstances are of particular relevance: - \"(i) Respondent No.2, Aftabuddin, is the husband of the respondent no. 1. While the Admission Deed records that Respondent Nos.2 and 3 retired from the partnership on 17.04.2007, the respondent No.1 herself admits that her husband continued to function as a partner of the firm from 2005 till 2010. This admission is wholly inconsistent with the recitals of the document relied upon by the respondent No.1. (ii) The Admission Deed does not find mention in any contemporaneous documentary record for nearly nine years and surfaced for the first time only on 02.10.2016, when the respondent No.1 issued a legal notice asserting a 50.33% stake in the firm. The complete absence of the document from the documentary trail prior thereto is a circumstance that cannot be lightly brushed aside.\n\n282 [2026] 2 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports (iii) The record further discloses that even after 17.04.2007, the respondent no.1 role in relation to the firm was not that of a partner but was confined to that of a guarantor for financial facilities availed by the firm. This is evident from several contemporaneous documents, including banking correspondent, promissory notes, hypothecation agreements, and letters addressed to Allahabad Bank between 2009 and 2010, all of which consistently portray Respondent Nos.2 and 3 as continuing partners of firm.\" 17. It is also of significance that, in proceedings under Section 9 of the Act, the High Court, by order dated 04.05.2018, had recorded a prima facie finding that the existence of the Admission Deed was doubtful and declined to grant interim protection. The relevant extract of the order reads as under: - \"Even without considering such aspect of the matter, the order impugned cannot be sustained on the simple ground that it was the admitted case of the respondent herein that for a period of more than ten years after the purported execution of the document of April 17, 2007 she had not been allowed any access to the partnership business or its books of accounts or given a share of its profits. If a party had not been diligent enough to protect her interest for a period of ten years, the party could not have come to court and expected any positive order by way of interim measure. Since it is evident that the court of the first instance in the present case failed to take relevant considerations into account while coming to an unreasoned tentative finding that the purported deed of April 17, 2007 had been executed by the parties, such order cannot be sustained.\" 18. The Special Leave Petition filed against the said order was dismissed by this Court, thereby lending finality to the said prima facie assessment between the parties, in the absence of any subsequent change in circumstances. 19. While findings in Section 9 proceedings are undoubtedly prima facie in nature, such findings, when they attain finality, cannot be ignored [2026] 2 S.C.R. 283 Rajia Begum v. Barnali Mukherjee in subsequent proceedings founded on the very same issue. The prima facie satisfaction recorded by the High Court regarding the doubtful existence of the arbitration agreement was, therefore, a relevant consideration while examining applications under Sections 8 and 11 of the Act. 20. The cumulative effect of the aforesaid circumstances lends considerable credence to contention of the appellant that the Admission Deed is not genuine. At the very least, the Admission Deed is under grave cloud of doubt, requiring a detailed and full- fledged inquiry. In the present case, arbitration clause does not exist independently but is embedded in the document whose existence is seriously disputed. Arbitration, it bears reiteration, is founded upon consent. A party may be bound by the arbitral process only if it is first shown, even at a prima facie level, that such a party had agreed to submit disputes to arbitration. Where the arbitration agreement itself is alleged to be forged or fabricated, the disputes ceases to be merely contractual and strikes at the very root of arbitral jurisdiction. A controversy of this nature falls squarely within the category of disputes that are generally recognized as non-arbitrable. 21. Both the Trial Court and the First Appellate Court had concurrently held that the allegations of fraud in the present case were serious and that the respondent no.1 had failed to produce the original Admission Deed or a certified copy thereof, as required under Section 8(2) of the Act. The aforesaid findings were not perfunctory, but were grounded in the material on record and in the statutory requirements. 22. The supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 227 of the Constitution is not an appellate jurisdiction in disguise, and it does not permit reappreciation of evidence. The High Court, while exercising jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution, was not justified in dislodging the concurrent findings and directing reference of the dispute to arbitration, particularly when the very existence of the arbitration agreement was under serious doubt. 23. Conversely, the High Court was correct in dismissing the respondent no.1's application under Section 11 of the Act. When the existence of the arbitration agreement itself is in serious dispute and requires adjudication, appointment of an arbitrator would be premature and legally impermissible.\n\n284 [2026] 2 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports (ix) CONCLUSION 24. For the reasons aforesaid, we hold as follows: (i) The dispute relating to the Admission Deed dated 17.04.2007 involves serious allegations going to the root of the arbitration agreement itself and is not amenable to arbitration at this stage. (ii) The order dated 24.09.2021 passed by the High Court allowing the respondent no.1's application under Section 8 of the Act is unsustainable and is hereby quashed and set aside. (iii) The order dated 11.03.2021 passed by the High Court rejecting the respondent no.1's application under Section 11 of the Act warrants no interference and is accordingly affirmed. 25. In the result, the appeal @ SLP (C) No. 6013 of 2021 is dismissed whereas the appeal @ SLP (C) No. 20262 of 2021 is allowed. There shall be no order as to costs. Result of the case: CA No.674 of 2026 is dismissed and CA No.675 of 2026 is allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Divya Pandey", "2026_2_285_294_EN_2026": "[2026] 2 S.C.R. 285 : 2026 INSC 113 The State of Tamil Nadu v.

The present suit has been instituted by the State of Tamil Nadu (hereinafter referred to as the \"plaintiff-State\") invoking the original jurisdiction of this Court under Article 131 of the Constitution of India, read with Part III of the Supreme Court Rules, 2013, against the State of Karnataka (hereinafter referred to as the \"defendant-State\") and the Union of India (hereinafter referred to as \"defendant no. 2\"), praying, inter alia, the grant of the following reliefs.: - (a) Declare that the unilateral action of the defendant- State, in proceeding to construct/ having proceeded to construct new Check Dams/ Dams and diversion structures across the Pennaiyar river its tributaries, Streams etc. to divert the water by gravity or pumping, and pumping from tanks surplusing into the Pennaiyar river or its tributaries without obtaining the prior consent of the plaintiff-State is illegal and violates the fundamental rights of the inhabitants of the plaintiff-State; (b) Grant permanent injunction restraining the defendant- State, from proceeding with the construction of Check Dam/ Anicut across Markandeyanadhi near Yargol village in Bangarapettai Taluk and construction of check dam/diversion structure across the Pennaiyar river and its tributaries, and pumping water from them to the existing tanks in the Pennaiyar basin by the defendant-State;\n\n288 [2026] 2 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports (c) Direct the defendant-State to ensure the natural flows in the Pennaiyar river and its tributaries to the Plaintiff State; and (d) Grant mandatory injunction directing the defendant- Union to take action on the plaintiff-State's letter dated 16.03.2018 with reference to construction of Dams and diversion structures and pumping schemes undertaken by the defendant-State in the Pennaiyar river; and (e) Pass such further decree or decrees or order or orders as this Hon'ble Court may deem fit and proper in the facts and circumstances of the case. 2. The facts, insofar as they are relevant and material for the adjudication of the controversy at hand, are set out hereinafter: 2.1. The plaintiff-State and the defendant-State are riparian States, being two among the three basin States, along with the Union Territory of Puducherry, through which the inter-State River Pennaiyar flows. According to the plaintiff-State, the dispute centres around the sharing of the waters of the Pennaiyar River and arises from the alleged construction of a check dam/ diversion by the defendant-State on the said river, which is stated to have impeded the free flow of water, thereby depriving the plaintiff-State of the benefits of the river waters flowing through the territories of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka and thereafter into Puducherry. 2.2. In the year 1892, with a view to delineate and acknowledge the extent of the rights of the party-States in relation to the use, control and distribution of the waters of an inter-State River, an agreement came to be executed between the erstwhile States of Madras and Mysore, the predecessor States of the present plaintiff-State and defendant-State, respectively. 2.3. According to the plaintiff-State, the dispute arose upon the defendant-State taking a decision to undertake five distinct works in the Pennaiyar River Basin within its territory. It is alleged that the execution of these works would interfere with the natural flow of the river, resulting in a substantial reduction of the waters reaching the plaintiff-State and thereby adversely [2026] 2 S.C.R. 289 The State of Tamil Nadu v. The State of Karnataka & Anr. impacting its water requirements. It is further asserted that the said projects have the potential to gravely affect the livelihood of lakhs of farmers in the districts of Krishnagiri, Dharmapuri, Thiruvannamalai, Villupuram and Cuddalore in the plaintiff-State. 2.4. In this context, the Chief Secretary of the plaintiff-State called upon the defendant-State to adhere to the Agreement of 1892, contending that, in terms thereof, no such works could have been undertaken by the defendant-State on the inter-State River without obtaining the prior consent of the plaintiff-State. 2.5. Subsequently, the plaintiff-State became aware that the defendant-State was proposing to construct check dams across a tributary of the River Pennaiyar. On 22nd May, 2013 when officials of the plaintiff-State conducted a field inspection of the site, they submitted a report recording that preliminary works relating to the construction of the dam had commenced, a fact which was further corroborated by the display board erected at the site. 2.6. Ultimately, vide communication dated 1st July, 2013, the defendant-State responded to the concerns raised by the plaintiff-State. In the said reply, the defendant-State asserted that the Agreement of 1892 was merely a political arrangement entered into in the prevailing regime of that period and had ceased to have effect upon the attainment of independence by the Union of India. On that premise, it was contended by the defendant-State that no consent of the lower riparian State, namely the plaintiff-State, was required. 2.7. Aggrieved by what is alleged to be the unilateral refusal of the defendant-State to comply with and act in accordance with the Agreement of 1892, the plaintiff-State approached this Court by instituting the present suit through a plaint dated 18th May, 2018. The pleadings stood completed upon the filing of the replication by the plaintiff-State on 7th May, 2019. 2.8. During the pendency of the present suit, the plaintiff-State filed an interlocutory application1, seeking, inter alia, the issuance of the following directions: - 1 I.A. No. 95384 of 2019\n\n290 [2026] 2 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports \"a. restrain the defendant-State and its instrumentalities from proceeding further with the construction of dam across Markandeyanadhu near Yargol Village; b. direct the defendant-State and its instrumentalities not to obstruct the natural flows to the downstream plaintiff-State pending the disposal of the present application.\" 2.9. This Court, vide order dated 14th November, 2019, dismissed the said application and declined to grant any interim relief, primarily on the ground that nearly 75% of the construction work had already been completed by the defendant-State and that the material on record prima facie indicated that the project in question had been undertaken after obtaining all requisite sanctions and permissions. However, the plaintiff-State was granted liberty to move an appropriate application invoking the powers of the Central Government for the constitution of an Inter-State River Water Disputes Tribunal in accordance with the provisions of the Inter-State River Water Disputes Act, 1956. 2.10. On 30th November, 2019 the plaintiff-State lodged a complaint under Section 3 of the Inter-State River Water Disputes Act, 1956, calling upon the Central Government to constitute a Tribunal for the adjudication of the Pennaiyar River water dispute. 3. In pursuance thereof, the process for the constitution of an Inter- State River Water Disputes Tribunal commenced under the aegis of the Central Government. In the interregnum, the plaintiff-State filed a further application2 dated 16th December, 2019, before this Court, seeking a direction to the Central Government to constitute an Inter-State River Water Disputes Tribunal. 4. Upon the negotiation process having been undertaken and no amicable resolution having been arrived at between the parties, defendant no. 2 filed an affidavit dated 2nd January, 2025, before this Court, stating that: - 2 I.A. No. 193417 of 2019 [2026] 2 S.C.R. 291 The State of Tamil Nadu v. The State of Karnataka & Anr. \"6. It is further submitted that this report is concluded that the Committee made sincere attempts to resolve the issue amicably between States of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka through discussions on multiple dates. The Committee has suggested some solutions to resolve the dispute. However, in view of the firm stand taken by the Govt. of Tamil Nadu, no consensus could be reached between two States on solutions. 7. . . . it was decided, as a last effort, to organise a meeting of the Water Resource Ministers of both States to try and create a consensus on the solutions suggested by the Negotiation Committee. . . .\" 5. Thus, negotiations in respect of the Pennaiyar River water dispute were initiated at the ministerial level. However, on 7th October, 2025 defendant no. 2, coordinating the negotiations between the plaintiff- State and the defendant-State, filed an additional affidavit before this Court stating that the earlier proposed meeting at the ministerial level had been postponed indefinitely. The relevant extract of the said affidavit reads as under: - \"5. . . . First meeting notice was issued to all party states for meting scheduled on 19.12.2024 at Ministers level but did not take place due to request of State of Karnataka to postpone the same as Winter Session of Karnataka Legislature Assembly was going during that period. . . . 6. It is submitted that as per tire direction of competent Authority, a preliminary meeting was held with the officials of party States under the Chairpersonship of Secretary (DoWR, RD&GR), on 03.03.2025. During the meeting, the Karnataka, reiterated that it has agreed for a total 15% release of water including 7.5% from Yargol dam and 7.5% from other tributary (Masti Sub-Basin), at the border, expressed interest to iron out any differences through negotiations. On the other hand, the Tamil Nadu stood to its position that a Tribunal be constituted for the resolution of dispute. 7. It is submitted that Second Meeting notice was issued to all party states for meeting scheduled on 18.03.2025\n\n292 [2026] 2 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports at Ministers Level. However, the Tamil Nadu expressed an opinion that any further negotiation would only delay the constitution of the Tribunal and stated that there is no need for any further negotiation at the level of Hon'ble Minister of Water Resources of the States. Further, the State of Tamil Nadu has reiterated its stand for constitution of Tribunal to resolve the Pennaiyar Water Dispute vide its communication dated 15.03.2025. . . . 8. It is submitted that in view of the opinion and stand taken by the Tamil Nadu, the proposed meeting [on 18.03.2025] at Ministers level has been postponed indefinitely vide DOWR, RD&GR dated 17.03.2025. . . .\" (emphasis laid) 6. We have heard Mr. V. Krishnamurthy and Mr. P. Wilson, learned Senior counsel for the plaintiff-State of Tamil Nadu, Mr. Shyam Diwan and Mr. Mohan V. Katarki learned Senior counsel, along with Mr. Shashi Kiran Shetty, learned Advocate-General, appearing for the defendant-State of Karnataka and Ms. Aishwarya Bhati, learned Additional Solicitor General, appearing for defendant no. 2 - Union of India. 7. The present Pennaiyar River water dispute has been pending consideration before this Court since the year 2018. Multiple efforts have been undertaken by the concerned stakeholders to bring about an amicable resolution of the dispute. However, we have no hesitation in recording that the negotiation process has not yielded any mutually acceptable outcome. In view of the inability of the parties to arrive at a common settlement, we consider it appropriate to call upon the Central Government to constitute a Tribunal in terms of the statutory framework, so that the dispute may be adjudicated in accordance with law. 8. In addition, the affidavit dated 7th October, 2025, filed by defendant no. 2 elucidates the prevailing position on the ground with respect to the statutorily mandated negotiation process. The said affidavit records that, during the ministerial-level negotiations, the plaintiff- State unequivocally conveyed that the Pennaiyar River water dispute [2026] 2 S.C.R. 293 The State of Tamil Nadu v. The State of Karnataka & Anr. ought to be resolved through adjudication by a Tribunal. It was in view of this firm stand adopted by the plaintiff-State that defendant no. 2 took a decision to indefinitely defer the negotiation process. 9. This Court, in T.N. Cauvery Neerppasana Vilaiporulgal Vivasayigal Nala Urimai Padhugappa Sangam v. Union of India,3 has held that where the statutorily prescribed negotiation process conducted under the aegis of the Central Government fails to bring about a resolution of an inter-State River water dispute, it becomes imperative for the Central Government to constitute a River Water Disputes Tribunal, and to refer the dispute for adjudication to such Tribunal. The Court accordingly observed as follows: - \"18. Section 4 indicates that on the basis of the request referred to in Section 3 of the Act, if Central Government is of the opinion that the water dispute cannot be settled by negotiation, it is mandatory for the Central Government to constitute a Tribunal for adjudication of the dispute. We were shown the Bill where in Section 4 the word 'may' was used. Parliament, however, substituted that word by 'shall' in the Act. Once we come to the conclusion that a stage has reached when the Central Government must be held to be of the opinion that the water dispute can no longer be settled by negotiation, it thus becomes its obligation to constitute a Tribunal and refer the dispute to it as stipulated under Section 4 of the Act. . . .\" (emphasis laid) 10. We, therefore, find no reason to refrain from directing the Central Government to issue an appropriate notification in the Official Gazette and to constitute a Water Disputes Tribunal for the adjudication of the inter se water dispute between the parties herein, within a period of one month from today. 11. We order as above. 12. With the aforesaid direction, the present suit stands disposed of. 3 (1990) 3 SCC 440\n\n294 [2026] 2 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports 13. Needless to mention that all questions, including those relating to the reliefs that may be available to the parties, are kept open for consideration by the Tribunal. Result of the case: Suit disposed of. †Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain", "2026_2_295_322_EN_2026": "[2026] 2 S.C.R. 295 : 2026 INSC 112 C. Velusamy v. K Indhera (Civil Appeal No. 696 of 2026) 03 February 2026 [Pamidighantam Sri Narasimha and Atul S. Chandurkar, JJ.] Issue for Consideration Whether a Court can entertain an application u/s.29A(5) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 to extend the mandate of the arbitrator(s) for making the award even after an 'award' is rendered, though after the expiry of the statutory limit of eighteen- month period. Headnotes† Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 - s.29A, 29A(5) - Disputes between the parties, sole arbitrator appointed - Pleadings were completed on 20.08.2022 which was the commencement of the period of twelve months provided u/s.29A(1) for making the Award - Before the conclusion of twelve months, parties filed a joint memo u/s.29A(3) and extended the mandate of the arbitrator by a further period of six months, ending on 20.02.2024 - Matter was reserved for final award on 09.09.2023 - Arbitrator finally passed the award on 11.05.2024 - In the meantime, the mandate of the arbitrator had terminated on 20.02.2024 - Respondent filed application u/s.34 for setting aside the award on the ground that the mandate of the arbitral tribunal expired and arbitral proceedings stood terminated before passing of the award - Appellant filed application u/s.29A seeking extension of the mandate of the tribunal - High Court dismissed the application u/s.29A as not maintainable whereas, s.34 petition filed by the respondent was allowed - Challenge to: Held: Provisions of the Act, particularly s.29A, must not be interpreted to infer a threshold bar for an application u/s.29A(5) for extension of the mandate of the arbitrator even when an award is passed, though after the expiry of the mandate - Court can entertain an application u/s.29A(5) and pass appropriate orders u/s.29A(4) 296 [2026] 2 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports for extension of the mandate of the arbitrator even after the award is rendered in the meanwhile - Thus, an application u/s.29A(5) for extension of the mandate of the arbitrator is maintainable even after the expiry of the time u/ss.29A(1) and (3) and even after rendering of an award during that time - Such an award is ineffective and unenforceable - But the power of the court to consider extension is not impaired by such an indiscretion of the arbitrator - While considering the application, the Court will examine if there is sufficient cause for extending the mandate, and in the process, it may impose such terms and conditions as the situation demands - It will also take into account other factors such as reduction of the fee of the arbitrator under proviso to s.29A(4) and also impose costs on parties if the fact situation so demands - Substitution is an option for the Court as the provision itself says, \"it shall be open for the Court to substitute\", and it will be exercised carefully - If the mandate is extended, the arbitral tribunal will pick up from where it was left, and seamlessly continue the proceeding from the stage at which the mandate had expired, and conclude within the time granted - Appeal against the judgment in Application No. 5993 of 2024 passed by the High Court is allowed - Application is restored to its original number - High Court will proceed with the said application and dispose it of as per the principles laid down in the present judgment.

[Para 20] Interpretation of Statutes - Statute providing legal remedies for the resolution of disputes - Duty of constitutional court: Held: While interpreting an enactment providing legal remedies for the resolution of disputes, a constitutional court has the obligation to ensure that the provision is: (a) accessible, (b) affordable, (c) expeditious and (d) cohesive - Accessibility requires the remedy to be easily available - Affordability is an aspect that is related to the cost of availing the remedy, it must be at a reasonable price - Expeditious nature of a remedy is concerned with the quick disposal and abhors unreasonable delays - Yet another facet of effective remedy is in its cohesiveness.

Conclusions .......................................................................... 18 1. Leave granted. I. Question of Law The following question of law has arisen for our consideration. Whether a Court can entertain an application under Section 29A(5) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 to extend the mandate of the arbitrator(s) for making the award even after an 'award' is rendered, though after the expiry of the statutory limit of eighteen- month period? 2. We have considered the text as well as the context in which Parliament introduced Section 29A to the Act, empowering the Court to extend the mandate of the arbitrator. The power and the jurisdiction of the Court are not impaired by the indiscretion of the arbitrator in rendering an 'award' without a mandate, particularly when such an award does not partake the character of a decree and is unenforceable under Section 36. We have also explained the important role that the Court plays while balancing the twin interests - of securing the remedy of resolution of disputes through arbitration and ensuring integrity in its conduct. Though, the questions that we are required to consider had not arisen for consideration in Rohan Builders (India) Pvt. Ltd. v. Berger Paints India Ltd.1, we approve the observations made therein that the Court can entertain an application under Section 29A(5) 1 2024 SCC OnLine SC 2494. 302 [2026] 2 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports and pass appropriate orders under Section 29A(4) for extension of the mandate of the arbitrator even after the award is rendered in the meanwhile. II. Facts 3. The contractual relationship between the appellant and the respondent is governed by three agreements to sell2. As disputes arose, the appellant filed an application under Section 11 of the Act and the High Court, by its order dated 19.04.2022,3 appointed a sole arbitrator. The arbitrator issued notice on 04.05.2022 and convened the first meeting on 28.05.2022, and the pleadings were completed on 20.08.2022, which date marked the commencement of the period of twelve months provided under Section 29A(1) of the 1996 Act for the making the Award. Before the conclusion of twelve months, parties filed a joint memo under Section 29A(3) and extended the mandate of the arbitrator by a further period of six months, ending on 20.02.2024. Arguments concluded, and the matter was reserved for final award on 09.09.2023. 3.1 Events that unfolded thereafter are indicative of myriad instances when real life fails to keep pace with human discipline for timelines. Despite the award being indicated to be almost ready, the proceedings were reopened on the representation of the parties. On the basis of emails from the respondent that settlement discussions are ongoing and are expected to be finalised by 15.11.2023, the matter was adjourned to 07.01.2024 and thereafter to 27.01.2024. However, when it was reported that the discussions did not fructify into a settlement, the arbitrator reserved the matter for award on 30.01.2024. Notwithstanding the reservation, discussions continued until March 2024, when a tripartite agreement was entered into between the appellant, the respondent, and a third party, M/s G Square Realtors Private Limited, which agreement was, however, not placed before the arbitrator. We are informed that the matter was adjourned to 27.04.2024 and thereafter to 04.05.2024, and the arbitrator finally passed the award on 11.05.2024, which was later stamped and issued to the parties on 25.06.2024. In the meantime, as 2 Agreements to sell dated 19.12.2015, 31.07.2018 and 24.03.2021. 3 Order dated 19.04.2022 in Arb.O.P.(Com.Div) No.2 of 2022. [2026] 2 S.C.R. 303 C. Velusamy v. K Indhera indicated earlier, the mandate of the arbitrator had terminated on 20.02.2024. 3.2 Aggrieved by the award dated 11.05.2024, the respondent filed an application under Section 34 of the 1996 Act for setting aside the award on the ground that the mandate of the arbitral tribunal expired and arbitral proceedings stood terminated before passing of the award. On the other hand, on 12.11.2024, the appellant filed an application under Section 29A of the Act seeking an extension of the mandate of the tribunal. 4. The High Court, by order dated 24.01.2025, impugned before us dismissed the application under Section 29A as not maintainable. On the other hand, the Section 34 petition filed by the respondent was allowed by the High Court on 14.02.2025, relying on the order dated 24.01.2025. III. Judgment of High Court 5. Rejecting reliance of respondent on the judgment of this Court in Rohan Builders (Supra), the High Court held that the said precedent only settles the issue about the timing of an application for extension of time and holds that it can be made even after the expiry of the initial twelve months or the extended six months period. The High Court felt that the Supreme Court was neither dealing with a situation where the award had already been passed, nor has laid down any principle permitting extension of the mandate after making of the award. 5.1 The High Court also distinguished the judgment of this Court in Ajay Protech Private Limited v. General Manager and Anr.4 by holding that, in that case award had not been passed, and the Court was only concerned with sufficient cause for the extension of time. 5.2 The High Court followed the decision rendered by the coordinate bench in Suryadev Alloys & Power Private Ltd. v. Sh. Govindaraja Textiles Pvt. Ltd.5 which held that under the 1996 Act, unlike the Arbitration Act, 1940, there is no provision empowering 4 2024 SCC OnLine SC 3381. 5 2020 SCC OnLine Mad 7858.\n\n304 [2026] 2 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports the Court to enlarge time after the award is made, and that an award passed after expiry of the arbitrator's mandate is a nullity. Apart from the decision of the coordinate bench in Suryadev Alloys (supra), the High Court also referred to and relied on the decision in Ayyasamy v. A. Shanmugavel6, which held that the Court cannot exercise power to extend the mandate after the award is delivered. 5.3 Referring to the decision of the Kerala High Court in RKEC Projects Limited v. Cochin Port Trust7, which had taken the view that extension can be granted even after the award was passed, the High Court, without much discussion, held that it does not lay down correct law, as it reads into Section 29A a power which the provision does not confer. 5.4 In conclusion, the High Court held that if an award is passed subsequent to the expiry of the mandate of the arbitrator, it is a nullity and the application for extension of the mandate of the arbitrator is not maintainable. IV. Submission 6. Appearing for appellant, Mrs. V Mohana, learned senior counsel relied on the decision in Rohan Builders (supra), to contend that an application under Section 29A is maintainable even after expiry of the prescribed period of 12 months or the extended 6 months, as the Court has power to extend the mandate either before or after expiry of the period under Sections 29A(1) and 29A(3). On the other hand, Mr. M. Vijayan, learned counsel assisted by Mr. P.S. Sudheer, AOR distinguished Rohan Builders (supra) and relied on the decision of the Madras High Court in Suryadev Alloys (supra) to argue that time cannot be extended after passing of the award as the 1996 Act contains no provision allowing post-award extension.

K Indhera Our Constitution, in its wisdom, establishes a comprehensive judicial architecture, encompassing the Supreme Court, the High Courts, and District Courts for public and ordinary civil/criminal remedies to safeguard this inalienable right. It is imperative that these judicial remedies are effective. In fact, the effectiveness of judicial remedies is a constitutional mission, and it is always a work in progress for the Supreme Court to ensure that the remedies are impartial, readily accessible, financially viable, swiftly administered, and comprehensively tailored. Beyond the realm of public law and ordinary civil/criminal remedies, as indicated hereinabove, parties to a dispute may elect to resolve their differences through mutually agreed procedures, crystallised in the form of contractual agreements. It is permissible in law to have such alternative dispute resolution mechanisms through contract. Section 28 of the Contract Act protects these alternative dispute resolution agreements through arbitration between contesting parties, fostering an environment conducive to expeditious and amicable dispute resolution. 7.1 The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 provides a simple, efficient, cost-effective, confidential, and fair dispute resolution remedy by empowering the parties to choose their arbitrators and also the procedure for the conduct of the arbitral proceedings. 7.2 Efficiency in the conduct of arbitral proceedings is integral to the effectiveness of the dispute resolution remedy through arbitration. Efficiency is inextricably connected with the expeditious conclusion of arbitral proceedings. While the statute incorporates party autonomy even with respect to the conduct and conclusion of arbitral proceedings, there is a statutory recognition of the power of the Court to step in wherever it is necessary to ensure that the process of resolution of the dispute is taken to its logical end, if, according to the Court, the circumstances so warrant. VI. Timelines under the 1940 Act 8. Under the Arbitration Act, 1940, the First Schedule prescribed that an arbitral award shall be made within four months from the date of reference or from the date on which the arbitrator was called upon to act by notice, subject to any extension granted thereafter. Section 28 of the 1940 Act empowered the Court to enlarge the time\n\n306 [2026] 2 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports for making the award, regardless of whether the prescribed period for making the award had expired or not or whether the award had already been made or not. Section 28 of the Arbitration Act, 1940, is extracted below for ready reference \"Section 28- Power to Court only to enlarge time for making award. (1) The Court may, if it thinks fit, whether the time for making the award has expired or not and whether the award has been made or not, enlarge from time to time for making the award. (2) Any provision in an arbitration agreement whereby the arbitrators or umpire may, except with the consent of all the parties to the agreement, enlarge the time for making the award, shall be void and of no effect.\" (emphasis supplied) VII. Timelines under the 1996 Act 9. Party autonomy, coupled with minimal intervention of judicial authorities, has been the guiding principle for the 1996 Act. This is perhaps the reason for not provisioning a statutory timeline for delivering awards and prescribing consequences of not delivering them on time. 9.1 In the event of failure of an arbitrator to act without undue delay, recourse was provided under Section 14 of the Act of 1996 to dual remedies-by approaching the arbitrator first and then the Court8. Section 14(1)(a) states that the mandate of an arbitrator would stand terminated if he either becomes de jure or de facto unable to perform his functions or, for other reasons, fails to act without undue delay. Section 14(2) states that, if a controversy remains concerning any of the grounds referred to in Section 14(1)(a), a party may, unless otherwise agreed with by the parties, apply to the Court to decide on the termination of the arbitrator's mandate. 8 Lancor Holdings Ltd v. Prem Kumar Menon & Ors., 2025 SCC OnLine SC 2319. [2026] 2 S.C.R. 307 C. Velusamy v. K Indhera On the other hand, Section 34 of the 1996 Act does not postulate delay in the delivery of the arbitral award as a ground in itself, to set it aside, except, as explained in the Lancor Holdings (supra), where the negative effect of the delay in the arbitral award is explicit and adversely reflects on the findings of the award. VIII. The felt need for the prescription of timelines for making the award and the recommendation of the law commission 10. The absence of a statutory time limit under the Act of 1996 had resulted in arbitrations remaining pending for several years, even without Court intervention, thereby defeating the very object of arbitration as a speedy dispute resolution mechanism. Accordingly, the Law Commission proposed the introduction of a structured timeline, with limited extensions by party consent and supervisory control by the Court thereafter, not with a view to terminating arbitral proceedings, but to compel their timely progress. The emphasis was on continuation of the arbitration, even pending applications for extension, so that procedural delays do not result in wastage of time, costs, or evidence already led. The legislative intent, therefore, was to ensure that an arbitral award is ultimately passed, with judicial intervention operating as a facilitative and corrective mechanism to curb delay, rather than as a means to abort the arbitral process. The relevant extract from the 176th Report of the Law Commission of India is extracted below: \"2.21.1 (…)But the omission of the provision for extension of time and therefore the absence of any time limit has given rise to another problem, namely, that awards are getting delayed before the arbitral tribunal even under the 1996 Act. One view is that this is on account of the absence of a provision as to time limit for passing an award. xx xx xx 2.21.3 (…)The time limit can be more realistic subject to extension only by the court. Delays ranging from five years to even fourteen years in a single arbitration have come to the Commission's notice. The Supreme Court of India has also referred to these delays of the arbitral tribunal. The point here is that these delays are occurring even in cases where there is no court intervention during the\n\n308 [2026] 2 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports arbitral process. The removal of the time limit is having its own adverse consequences. There can be a provision for early disposal of the applications for extension, if that is one of the reasons for omitting a provision prescribing a time limit, say one month. Parties can be permitted to extend time by one year. Pending the application for extension, we propose to allow the arbitration proceedings to continue.(…) xx xx xx 2.21.4 It is, therefore, proposed to implement the recommendation made in the 76th Report of the Law Commission with the modification that an award must be passed at least within one year of the arbitrators entering on the reference. The initial period will be one year. Thereafter, parties can, by consent, extend the period upto a maximum of another one year. Beyond the one year plus the period agreed to by mutual consent, the court will have to grant extension. Applications for extension are to be disposed of within one month. While granting extension, the court may impose costs and also indicate the future procedure to be followed by the tribunal . There will, therefore, be a further proviso, that further extension beyond the period stated above should be granted by the Court. We are not inclined to suggest a cap on the power of extension as recommended by the Law Commission earlier. There may be cases where the court feels that more than 24 months is necessary. It can be left to the court to fix an upper limit. It must be provided that beyond 24 months, neither the parties by consent, nor the arbitral tribunal could extend the period. The court's order will be necessary in this regard. But in order to see that delay in disposal of extension applications does not hamper arbitration, we propose to allow arbitration to continue pending disposal of the application. 2.21.5 One other important aspect here is that if there is a delay beyond the initial one year and the period agreed to by the parties (with an upper of another one year) and also any period of extension granted by the Court, there [2026] 2 S.C.R. 309 C. Velusamy v. K Indhera is no point in terminating the arbitration proceedings. We propose it as they should be continued till award is passed. Such a termination may indeed result in waste of time and money for the parties after lot of evidence is led. In fact, if the proceedings were to terminate and the claimant is to file a separate suit, it will even become necessary to exclude the period spent in arbitration proceedings, if he was not at fault, by amending sec. 43(5) to cover such a situation. But the Commission is of the view that there is a better solution to the problem. The Commission, therefore, proposes to see that an arbitral award is ultimately passed even if the above said delays have taken place. In order that there is no further delay, the Commission proposes that after the period of initial one year and the further period agreed to by the parties (subject to a maximum of one year) is over, the arbitration proceedings will nearly stand suspended and will get revived as soon as any party to the proceedings files an application in the Court for extension of time. In case none of the parties files an application, even then the arbitral tribunal may seek an extension from the Court. From the moment the application is filed, the arbitration proceedings can be continued. When the Court takes up the application for extension, it shall grant extension subject to any order as to costs and it shall fix up the time schedule for the future procedure before the arbitral tribunal. It will initially pass an order granting extension of time and fixing the time frame before the arbitral tribunal and will continue to pass further orders till time the award is passed. This procedure will ensure that ultimately an award is passed.\" (emphasis supplied) IX. Introduction of Section 29A & its interpretation: 11. It is in the above-referred background that the Arbitration Act was amended with retrospective effect from 23.10.2015 to effectively deal with delays in arbitral proceedings by inserting Section 29A. The Statement of Objects and Reasons records that practical difficulties\n\n310 [2026] 2 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports had arisen, necessitating amendments to make arbitration more user-friendly, cost-effective, and expeditious. Accordingly, provision was made requiring the arbitral tribunal to render the award within twelve months from the date it enters upon the reference, with liberty to the parties to extend the period by a further six months, any extension thereafter being permissible only by order of the Court on sufficient cause being shown. Thereafter, the Act of 1996 was further amended w.e.f. 30-8-2019 to provide, inter alia, that, where an application seeking extension of time under sub-section (5) of Section 29A is pending, the mandate of the arbitrator shall continue until such application is finally decided. 11.1 Section 29A of the 1996 Act as amended is extracted below for ready reference; \"Section 29A: Time limit for arbitral award. (1) The award in matters other than international commercial arbitration shall be made by the arbitral tribunal within a period of twelve months from the date of completion of pleadings under sub-section (4) of section 23. Provided that the award in the matter of international commercial arbitration may be made as expeditiously as possible and endeavour may be made to dispose off the matter within a period of twelve months from the date of completion of pleadings under sub-section (4) of section 23. (2) If the award is made within a period of six months from the date the arbitral tribunal enters upon the reference, the arbitral tribunal shall be entitled to receive such amount of additional fees as the parties may agree. (3) The parties may, by consent, extend the period specified in sub-section (1) for making award for a further period not exceeding six months. (4) If the award is not made within the period specified in sub-section (1) or the extended period specified under sub-section (3), the mandate of the arbitrator(s) [2026] 2 S.C.R. 311 C. Velusamy v. K Indhera shall terminate unless the Court has, either prior to or after the expiry of the period so specified, extended the period: Provided that while extending the period under this sub-section, if the Court finds that the proceedings have been delayed for the reasons attributable to the arbitral tribunal, then, it may order reduction of fees of arbitrator(s) by not exceeding five per cent. for each month of such delay: [Provided further that where an application under sub- section (5) is pending, the mandate of the arbitrator shall continue till the disposal of the said application: Provided also that the arbitrator shall be given an opportunity of being heard before the fees is reduced.] (5) The extension of period referred to in sub-section (4) may be on the application of any of the parties and may be granted only for sufficient cause and on such terms and conditions as may be imposed by the Court. (6) While extending the period referred to in sub- section (4), it shall be open to the Court to substitute one or all of the arbitrators and if one or all of the arbitrators are substituted, the arbitral proceedings shall continue from the stage already reached and on the basis of the evidence and material already on record, and the arbitrator(s) appointed under this section shall be deemed to have received the said evidence and material. (7) In the event of arbitrator(s) being appointed under this section, the arbitral tribunal thus reconstituted shall be deemed to be in continuation of the previously appointed arbitral tribunal. (8) It shall be open to the Court to impose actual or exemplary costs upon any of the parties under this section. (9) An application filed under sub-section (5) shall be disposed of by the Court as expeditiously as possible,\n\n312 [2026] 2 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports and endeavour shall be made to dispose of the matter within a period of sixty days from the date of service of notice on the opposite party.\" X. International perspective on the validity of the arbitral award rendered after the stipulated statutory time limit. 12. It is well recognized that a fixed time limit for the rendering of an arbitral award may foreclose the mandate of a tribunal if breached. However, such limits are not intended to frustrate the arbitral process. In appropriate cases, Courts have retroactively extended timelines and even upheld awards rendered outside agreed deadlines where it was necessary to preserve justice and prevent the arbitration from being defeated by technical non-compliance. 12.1 Under the earlier English Arbitration Act, 1950, Section 27 expressly empowered the Court to enlarge the time for making an award \"whether that time has expired or not.\" Interpreting this provision, the English Court of Appeal in Oakland Metal Co Ltd. v. D. Benaim & Co. Ld.9 confirmed that the expiry of a contractual time limit does not automatically extinguish the Court's jurisdiction to enlarge time. The Court recognised that it retained a wide discretion to extend time even after the agreed deadline had passed, thereby preventing the arbitration from failing solely by effluxion of time. 12.2 Similar language has been retained in the current English Arbitration Act 1996. Section 50(4) provides that the Court's power to extend the time for making an award \"may be exercised whether or not the time previously fixed has expired.\" The statutory scheme, therefore, makes it clear that an agreed deadline for making an arbitral award does not automatically and irreversibly invalidate an award rendered late. Rather, the Act preserves a retrospective judicial power to extend time, where the statutory conditions are met. 12.3 Although English case law directly applying section 50(4) remains limited, leading commentaries have recognized that, where an arbitral tribunal fails to comply with an agreed time 9 [1953] 2 QB 261. [2026] 2 S.C.R. 313 C. Velusamy v. K Indhera limit, recourse to the Court may be the only practical solution. For example, Jeffrey Waincymer observes in Procedure and Evidence in International Arbitration that difficulties arise where an arbitrator is removed or replaced for failure to comply with a time limit, and the deadline has already expired. In such circumstances, Courts may step in and even retroactively extend the mandate: \"If a time limit is imposed and an application is made to remove an arbitrator for failing to comply with the time limit, a problem arises in terms of the powers of a truncated or replacement tribunal to subsequently render an award. If there is no power to extend, how can a truncated tribunal or a replacement arbitrator meet the deadline that has expired? Some lex arbitri allow for extensions in such circumstances. The functus officio problem has led Belgian law to adopt a more practical solution to the effect that after six months has elapsed, the parties may apply to the court to set a time limit for rendering of the award. Section 50(4) of the English Arbitration Act 1996 allows a court to extend the time even if the time previously fixed has expired.10 (emphasis supplied) 12.4 In Redfern and Hunter on International Arbitration, it is noted that Courts in many jurisdictions have been reluctant to invalidate an award solely on the basis that it was rendered late: \"It is important that a fixed time limit for rendering the award should not enable one of the parties to frustrate the arbitration. This might happen if a fixed limit were to run from the date of the appointment of the arbitral tribunal, rather than, for example, that of the end of the hearings. If a court has no power to intervene on the application of one party alone and the time limit can be extended only by agreement of the parties, a party might frustrate the proceedings simply by 10 'Part II: The Process of an Arbitration, Chapter 6: Establishing the Procedural Framework', in Jeffrey Maurice Waincymer, Procedure and Evidence in International Arbitration (2012), p. 418.\n\n314 [2026] 2 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports refusing to agree to any extension of time. However, the courts of many countries would be reluctant to invalidate a late award in such a case. For example, in New York, it was held that an untimely award was not a nullity, even though the issue of timeliness was properly raised: the court stated that, without a finding of prejudice, there was no justification for denying confirmation of the award.\"11 (emphasis supplied) 12.5 Commentaries on institutional rules such as ICC Rules acknowledge similar powers. Article 31(1) of the Rules sets a six-month limit from the signing of the terms of reference for the rendering of the final award. Under Article 31(2), a Court may render an extension of the time limit and revive the mandate of a tribunal that is deemed functus officio. In doing so, a Court may retroactively revive the tribunal's mandate, and even render an award passed beyond the time limit valid.12 12.6 A recent decision of the Privy Council further illustrates this pragmatic approach. In Alphamix Ltd v District Council of Rivière du Rempart (Mauritius)13, the Privy Council upheld an arbitral award that had been annulled by the Mauritian Courts on the basis that it was issued three days after the agreed deadline. The applicable Mauritian Civil Procedure Code provided that an arbitrator's mandate would lapse after six months unless extended, and that an award rendered outside the mandate was liable to annulment. Although the award was formally issued three days late, the Privy Council found that the parties had tacitly and unequivocally agreed to permit the short delay, particularly in light of the arbitrator's illness and the absence of objection from either party. That tacit agreement was held to have extended the arbitrator's mandate, with the result that the award remained valid. 11 '9. Award', in Nigel Blackaby, Constantine Partasides, et al., Redfern and Hunter on International Arbitration (Seventh Edition) (2023), at para.9.169. 12 Fadri Lenggenhager, 'Chapter 17, Part II: Commentary on the ICC Rules, Article 31 [Time limit for the final award]', in Manuel Arroyo (ed), Arbitration in Switzerland: The Practitioner's Guide (Second Edition) (2018). pp. 2447. 13 [2023] UKPC 20, at para 26. [2026] 2 S.C.R. 315 C. Velusamy v. K Indhera 12.7 By contrast, there are also authorities demonstrating that Courts may annul late awards where delay is substantial and unjustified. Under Singapore law, the High Court in Ting Kang Chung John v Teo Hee Lai Building Constructions Pte Ltd.14 set aside an award that had been issued well beyond the agreed deadline. The arbitration concerned a modest construction dispute conducted under the Arbitration Rules of the Singapore Institute of Architects, which required the arbitrator to issue an award within 60 days of the close of the hearing. The arbitrator issued the award more than a year after that deadline. 12.8 When the award was challenged, the arbitrator sought belatedly to apply for an extension of time. The Court refused his application, noting that where parties had agreed to specify a deadline for the award to be issued, the principle of party autonomy meant that the Court should not lightly override this agreement. The Court noted that an extension would be granted only to (i) prevent substantial injustice, (ii) where there was no prejudice to the opposing party, and (iii) where there were very good reasons to justify the delay. One crucial factor in refusing the application was the failure by the arbitrator to apply for an extension until after his award was challenged. XI. Conclusions 13. Section 29A, as explained in recent decisions of this Court in Rohan Builders (supra), Lancor Holdings (supra) and Jagdeep Chowgule v. Sheela Chowgule15 can be formulated as under: (I) Sub-section (1) of Section 29A mandates that the award shall be made within 12 months of the completion of pleadings before the Arbitral Tribunal16. While sub-section (2) incentivises expeditious making of the Award, proviso to sub-section (4) 14 [2010] SGHC 20, at para. 41. 15 2026 INSC 92. 16 Explained, in Rohan Builders (India) Pvt Ltd v. Berger Paints India Limited, 2024 SC Online SC 2494, as \"Prior to the enactment of Section 29A of the A & C Act did not specify a time limit for making an arbitral award. This was deliberate, given the fact that the First Schedule and Section 28 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 led to litigation and delay. Section 29A, as quoted above, was inserted by Act 3 of 2016 with retrospective effect from 23.10.2015. The Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015 aimed to ensure that arbitration proceedings are completed without unnecessary adjournments and delay.\" 316 [2026] 2 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports and sub-section (8)authorises the Court to impose penalty for delay in making the award. (II) Sub-section (3) enables parties, by consent, to extend the period of 12 months for making the award by a further period not exceeding 6 months. (III) If the award is not made within the stipulated period of 12 months or the extended period of 6 months, the mandate of the arbitrator(s) shall terminate17. (IV) This termination is subject to the power of the Court to extend the period18. (V) The 'Court' under Section 29A shall be the Civil Court of ordinary original jurisdiction in a district and includes the High Court in exercise of its original civil jurisdiction under Section 2(1)(e), and shall not be the High Court or the Supreme Court under Section 11(6) of the Act. Section 42 of the Act relating to jurisdiction for applications will also not apply to Section 11 of the Act19. (VI) There is no statutory prescribed time limit for the Court to exercise the power under Section 29A(4) for extending the period, except for its own discretion. The Court can exercise the power before or after the expiry of the period under sub- 17 Section 29A(4) of the 1996 Act. 18 The Law Commission's 176th Report @ 2.21.5 explains the purpose and object of vesting of this power as follows: \"One other important aspect here is that if there is a delay beyond the initial one year and the period agreed to by the parties (with an upper of another one year) and also any period of extension granted by the Court, there is no point in terminating the arbitration proceedings. We propose it as they should be continued till award is passed. Such a termination may indeed result in waste of time and money for the parties after lot of evidence is led. In fact, if the proceedings were to terminate and the claimant is to file a separate suit, it will even become necessary to exclude the period spent in arbitration proceedings, if he was not at fault, by amending sec. 43(5) to cover such a situation. But the Commission is of the view that there is a better solution to the problem. The Commission, therefore, proposes to see that an arbitral award is ultimately passed even if the above said delays have taken place. In order that there is no further delay, the Commission proposes that after the period of initial one year and the further period agreed to by the parties (subject to a maximum of one year) is over, the arbitration proceedings will nearly stand suspended and will get revived as soon as any party to the proceedings files an application in the Court for extension of time. In case none of the parties files an application, even then the arbitral tribunal may seek an extension from the Court. From the moment the application is filed, the arbitration proceedings can be continued. When the Court takes up the application for extension, it shall grant extension subject to any order as to costs and it shall fix up the time schedule for the future procedure before the arbitral tribunal. It will initially pass an order granting extension of time and fixing the time frame before the arbitral tribunal and will continue to pass further orders till time the award is passed. This procedure will ensure that ultimately an award is passed.\" 19 State of West Bengal v. Associated Contractors (2015) 1 SCC 32. [2026] 2 S.C.R. 317 C. Velusamy v. K Indhera sections 29A(1) or (3)20. Further, there is no prescription of an outer limit for extending the time for the conclusion of arbitral proceedings. Given this power, the Court will exercise it with circumspection, balancing the remedy with the rights of other stakeholders. (VII) The power of the Court to extend the time under sub-section (4) may be exercised on an application by any of the parties. Once such an application for extension of time is pending, the mandate of the arbitrator shall continue till the disposal of such application under sub-section (9). The Court shall endeavour to dispose of such an application within 60 days21. (VIII) Delay in the delivery of an arbitral award, by itself, is not sufficient to set aside that award. It is only when the effect of the undue delay in the delivery of an arbitral award is explicit and adversely reflects on the findings therein, such delay and, more so, if it remains unexplained, can be construed to result in the award being in conflict with the public policy of India.22 (IX) Under Section 29A(6), while exercising the power of extension, it shall be open to the Court to substitute one or all the arbitrators. This is a discretionary power that the Court would exercise in the facts and circumstances of the case. Upon substitution, the reconstituted tribunal shall be deemed to be in continuation of the previously appointed tribunal as per Section 29A(7) and shall continue from the stage already reached and on the basis of evidence already on record. The newly appointed arbitrators shall be deemed to have received the evidence and materials. (X) Vesting of the power of substitution, under Section 29A(6), is on the \"Court\" and this Court is the \"Court\" as defined in Section 2(1)(e). The text, as well as the context for identifying the Court in Section 29A(6), as well as in Section 29A(4), is the Court in Section 2(1)(e). The expression 'Court' in other provisions must be guided by the meaning given in Section 2(1)(e) 23. 20 Section 29A(4) of the 1996 Act. 21 Section 29A(9) of the 1996 Act. 22 Lancor Holdings (supra). 23 Jagdeep Chowgule (supra). 318 [2026] 2 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports 14. Section 29A of the Act does not, in terms, bar an application for extension of the mandate of an arbitrator in the event of the delivery of an award. There is no such prescription anywhere in the section. In the first place, if an award is made after expiry of the mandate, then there is no doubt about the fact that such an award is non est. A better expression would be to hold that such an award would be unenforceable under Section 36. Such an award need not be challenged under Section 34. 15. Naturally, a unilateral act or the indiscretion of the arbitrator in making such an award will have no bearing on the power and jurisdiction vested in the Court under Section 29A. We have more hesitation in concluding that the Parliament has never intended that the act of an arbitrator in delivering an award when the mandate had expired would denude the power and jurisdiction vested in the Court. This power and jurisdiction stand on its own footing and is uninfluenced by the act of the arbitrator in passing an award without mandate. 16. Secondly, the expression, \"if an award is not made\" in sub-section (4) is employed in the context of enabling the Court to extend the mandate of the arbitrator. The context in which the phrase is used makes it clear that the sub-section is not addressing a situation where an arbitral award has been rendered after the mandate of the arbitrator has expired, but rather to declare that the Court can extend the period before or after the expiry of the mandate. This is clearly explained in Rohan Builders (supra). 17. Rohan Builders (supra) also clarifies the context in which the expression 'terminates' has been used in the section. It is explained that it is transitory and is subject to the exercise of power by the Court. \"14. Accordingly, the termination of the arbitral mandate is conditional upon the non-filing of an extension application and cannot be treated as termination stricto sensu. The word \"terminate\" in the contextual form does not reflect termination as if the proceedings have come to a legal and final end, and cannot continue even on filing of an application for extension of time. Therefore, termination under Section 29A(4) is not set in stone or absolutistic in character. 20. Lastly, Section 29A(6) does not support the narrow interpretation of the expression \"terminate\". It states [2026] 2 S.C.R. 319 C. Velusamy v. K Indhera that the court - while deciding an extension application under Section 29A(4) - may substitute one or all the arbitrators. Section 29A(7) states that if a new arbitrator(s) is appointed, the reconstituted Arbitral Tribunal shall be deemed to be in continuation of the previously appointed Arbitral Tribunal. This obliterates the need to file a fresh application under Section 11 of the A & C Act for the appointment of an arbitrator. In the event of substitution of arbitrator(s), the arbitral proceedings will commence from the stage already reached. Evidence or material already on record is deemed to be received by the newly constituted tribunal. The aforesaid deeming provisions underscore the legislative intent to effectuate efficiency and expediency in the arbitral process. This intent is also demonstrated in Sections 29A(8) and 29A(9). The court in terms of Section 29A(8) has the power to impose actual or exemplary costs upon the parties. Lastly, Section 29A(9) stipulates that an application for extension under sub-section (5) must be disposed of expeditiously, with the endeavour of doing so within sixty days from the date of filing.\" 18. Intention of the Parliament to secure the arbitral proceedings and to ensure that they are taken to their logical conclusion of a binding award is evident from provisions such as, enabling Courts to exercise the power of extension before or after the expiry of the 18 month period [Section 29A(4)], declaring continuation of the proceedings till the application for extension is pending [proviso to 29A(4)], declaring that upon extension, the existing proceedings would continue uninterruptedly [Section 29A(6) & (7)]. These provisions make it evident that the intention of the Parliament is to safeguard the conduct and conclusion of arbitral proceedings. 19. Though the fact situation that has arisen in our case was not available in Rohan Builders (supra) in the sense that the arbitrator had not passed an award after expiry of the mandate, the following observation in Rohan Builders is relevant for our consideration; \"21. …The power to extend time period for making of the award vests with the court, and not with the Arbitral Tribunal. Therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal may not pronounce the award till an application under Section 29A(5) of the\n\n320 [2026] 2 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports A & C Act is sub-judice before the court. In a given case, where an award is pronounced during the pendency of an application for extension of period of the Arbitral Tribunal, the court must still decide the application under sub-section (5), and may even, where an award has been pronounced, invoke, when required and justified, sub-sections (6) to (8), or the first and third proviso to Section 29A(4) of the A & C Act.\" (emphasis supplied) 20. Vesting of power and jurisdiction in the Court, in our opinion, is a complete answer to any apprehension that extension of time, even in cases where an 'award' is passed, could introduce a culture of indiscipline, as arbitrator(s) and/or counsels could become indifferent to the mandatory timelines. This apprehension is not true. There is no automatic extension of time. The Court will and must exercise its discretion only after evaluating the facts and circumstances after close scrutiny. Section 29A, in terms, enables the court to adopt distinct measures to ensure dynamic and efficient conduct of arbitral proceedings with integrity and expedition. The following empowerments are in the nature of instruments in the toolkit of Section 29A, enabling the courts to deploy them as and when the factual matrix demands: i. Court has the power to extend the time before or after the expiry of the statutorily stipulated period. [Section 29A(4)] ii. Court is empowered to take measures to reduce the fee of the arbitrators if the Court is of the opinion that the proceedings are delayed for the reasons attributable to the Arbitrators. [Proviso to Section 29A(4)] iii. Court can grant an extension of the time period upon a finding that there is sufficient cause for such extension. [Section 29A(5)] iv. Court, while extending the mandate even when there is sufficient cause, is empowered to impose such terms and conditions as it thinks fit for efficiency and integrity of the arbitral proceedings. [Section 29A(5)] [2026] 2 S.C.R. 321 C. Velusamy v. K Indhera v. Courts are specifically empowered to substitute any one or all the arbitrators, if in the opinion of the Court the facts demand. This is a discretion that the Court would exercise with caution and circumspection24. [Section 29A(6)] vi. The Court is empowered not only to grant costs but also to impose exemplary and actual costs upon any of the parties, if the situation so demands. [Section 29A(8)] 21. In view of the above analysis, we are of the opinion that provisions of the Act, particularly Section 29A, must not be interpreted to infer a threshold bar for an application under Section 29A(5) for extension of the mandate of the arbitrator even when an award is passed, though after the expiry of the mandate. 22. While interpreting an enactment providing legal remedies for the resolution of disputes, a constitutional court has the obligation to ensure that the provision is: (a) accessible, (b) affordable, (c) expeditious and (d) cohesive. Accessibility requires the remedy to be easily available25. Affordability is an aspect that is related to the cost of availing the remedy, it must be at a reasonable price. Expeditious nature of a remedy is concerned with the quick disposal and abhors unreasonable delays. Yet another facet of effective remedy is in its cohesiveness. 23. In conclusion, we hold that an application under Section 29A(5) for extension of the mandate of the arbitrator is maintainable even after the expiry of the time under Sections 29A(1) and (3) and even after rendering of an award during that time. Such an award is ineffective and unenforceable. But the power of the court to consider extension is not impaired by such an indiscretion of the arbitrator. While considering the application, the Court will examine if there is sufficient cause for extending the mandate, and in the process, it may impose such terms and conditions as the situation demands. 24 It is clarified that Mohan Lal Fatehpuria v. M/s Bharat Textiles & Ors. 2025 INSC 1409 does not mandate the substitution of an arbitrator as an inevitable consequence when the court is considering extension of mandate that had already expired as was argued. In fact, it is clear that the judgment proceeds to substitute the arbitrator as the situation \"warranted\". The court held \"in view of the statutory scheme and undisputed factual position, we are satisfied that the case warranted the exercise of jurisdiction under Section 29A(6) of the Act\". This quotation is sufficient to conclude that the power of substitution would be exercised as such by the Court as a discretion and in the facts and circumstances of the case. 25 NBCC (India) Ltd. v. State of West Bengal, 2025 INSC 54.\n\n322 [2026] 2 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports The Court will also take into account other factors such as reduction of the fee of the arbitrator under proviso to Section 29A(4) and also impose costs on parties if the fact situation so demands. Substitution is an option for the Court as the provision itself says, \"it shall be open for the Court to substitute\", and it will be exercised carefully. If the mandate is extended, the arbitral tribunal will pick up the thread from where it was left, and seamlessly continue the proceeding from the stage at which the mandate had expired, and conclude within the time granted. 24. In view of the above, the appeal against the judgment and order dated 24.01.2025 in Application No. 5993 of 2024 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Madras is allowed. The Application No. 5993 of 2024 is restored to its original number and the High Court will proceed with the said application and dispose it of as per the principles laid down in our judgment. Result of the case: Appeal against the judgment in Application No. 5993 of 2024 is allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Divya Pandey"}
