His application for remission was considered expeditiously by the State Government after interference of the Supreme Court. The State Government while granting remission imposed four conditions on the appellant. The appellant contended that two out of these four conditions are vague, subjective and arbitrary. The issue before the Hon'ble Supreme Court is the legality of these two conditions imposed by the appropriate government in exercise of its powers under Section 432(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short, 'the CrPC') while remitting the life sentence of the appellant. Headnotes† Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 - s.432(1) - Explained: Held: The appropriate government has the power to remit the whole or any part of the punishment of a convict unconditionally or subject to certain conditions - Actual remission takes effect only after the convict accepts the conditions - There is an identical provision in the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 (BNSS) in form of section 473(1).
